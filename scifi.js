Any similarity to actual persons is coincidental. #c a fcopy. Printed ia U.S. A. A chat with the editor  i #  science fiction magazine called IF. The title was selected after much thought because of its brevity and on the theory it is indicative of the field and will be easy to remember. The tentative title that just morning and couldn't remember it until we'd had a cup of coffee, it was summarily discarded. A great deal of thought and effort lias gone into the formation of this magazine. We have had the aid of several very talented and generous people, for which we are most grateful. Much is due them for their warmhearted assistance. And now that the bulk of the formative work is done, we will try to maintain IF as one of the finest books on the market.  t a great public demand for our magazine. In short, why will you buy IF? We cannot, in honesty, say we will publish at all times the best science fiction in the field. That would not be true. But we will have access to the best stories, and we will get our fair share of works from the best writers. We definitely will not talk \"adult\" or \"juvenile\" relative to our content as we feel such terms are misleading. We would rather think at all times in the terms of \"story\". Some of the greatest escapist literature ever written, Treasure Island for instance, could be put into either category or both. And if Edgar Rice Burroughs is juvenile, then so are we, because the late master has given us some memorable thrills. Frankly, we don't think you'll buy IF because you feel we print better yams than any other mag. You will buy it, we hope, because you like its personality. Every magazine, we feel, does have a definite personality of its own. This personality is usually a reflection of the editors, their way of thinking, their appreciation of tKe market, their interpretation of what you will like best in stories and artwork. We have tried to make IF different from any other science fiction magazine on the stands while still building it along the lines of what every science fiction mag must be. Aside from the letter columns and the editorial, which are departments of field-wide use, we have not copied any feature of any other magazine. We will not, for instance, review fanzines, because we feel that is being most ably done by other mags. Nor will we, as a general practice, review books because that appears to us to be overdone. a personality of our own and hope thereby to establish an affinity with a large number of readers who will remember IF when they buy a science fiction mag as one they like and wish to continue reading. At all times we will hew to the story-line and will exhort with our writers to do the same. As an example, when Howard Browne phoned to talk over the plot for his lead novel in this issue, he described what ivas without doubt a staggering premise, a really startling concept. \"But,\" he mourned, S T suppose I'll have to bend it around to give them the good old conventional ending.\" We told Howard, \"Not for IF, chum. Remember the old creed we live by. A writer may cheat on his wife, but he is ever true to the story-line. He may haul his infant son around by one leg. but he carries a good story-idea like a holy relic. If there is only one logical ending for Twelve Times ZerG, that's the ending we want.\" Therefore, we do not feel the majority of readers necessarily want a happy ending regardless of all else. Not when it is incompatable with the aura of realism created by the writer. A check-list of fiction masterpieces certainly bears this out. The furor created by a little piece called Sorry , Wrong Number would certainly not have been forthcoming had the bedridden lady been rescued in the last paragraph. Romeo and Juliet would have beep nothing more than the smooth effort of the world's greatest writer if Romeo had gotten there in time. Yet, in modern fiction, he gets there in time with such amazing regularity one feels he has memorized at least  a dozen time-tables. The result has been unnumbered carloads of mediocre fiction. Also -- though we don't wish to underscore the point too heavily -- what could more surely have smothered the greatness of Wuthering Heights than a happy ending?  that IF will be a magazine given over to tragedy. W e will only insist that our writers create scenes and climaxes that fix the story rather than cater to that old \"debil\" formula. And in so doing we have an entirely selfish motive. This: As the years go by, we want to look back with personal pride upon an everlengthening list of great stories. So the book you now hold in your hands is a new one titled IF. We hope you will like it -- not for just a day -- not for just a month. But for years to come. pwf  Police grilled him mercilessly # while eyes from a hundred worlds looked on  It was a love-triangle murder that made today's headlines but the answer lay hundreds of thousands of light years away! one of the basement rooms. He moved slowly and with a kind of painful dignity, as a man moves on his way to the firing squad. A rumpled shock of black hair pointed up the extreme pallor of a gaunt face, empty at the moment of all expression. Harsh light from an overhead fixture winked back from tiny beads of perspiration dotting the waxen skin of his forehead. The three men with him watched him out of faces as expressionless as his own. They were ordinary men who wore ordinary clothing in an ordinary way. yet in the way they moved and in the w r ay they stood you knew they were I hard men who were in a hard and largely unpleasant business. One of them motioned casually toward a straight-backed chair almost exactly in the center of the room. \"Sit there, Cordell  I he said.  A quiet voice, not especially deep, yet its seemed to bounce off the painted concrete walls. Wordless, the young man obeyed. Sitting, he seemed as stiff and uncompromising as before. The man who had spoken made a vague gesture and the overhead light  went out, replaced simultaneously by strong rays from a spotlight aimed full at the eyes of the seated figure. Involuntarily the young man's head turned aside to avoid came out of the wall of darkness and jerked it back again. # 'Just to remind you , # the quiet voice continued conversationally, \"I'm Detective Lieutenant Kirk, Homicide Bureau . # A pair of hands thrust 'a second chair toward the circle of light. Kirk swung it around and dropped onto the seat, resting his arms along the back, facing the man across a distance of hardly more than inches. In the pitiless glare of the spotlight CordelPs cheekbones  stood out sharply, and under his deepset eyes were dark smudges of exhaustion. His rigid posture, his blank expression, his silence -- these were laid out, our first idea was to stage the scoop of the century: Get the lead novel from Howbe given an infant publication than Browne's name on the cover. We asked Howard and he asked bis boss, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Davis said, \"Sure.\" oldest science-fiction publication in the world. It has the largest circulation in its field and up to January # th (the day IF went on the science fiction magazine your money could buy. It has the best writers in the field. Its departments are exfanzine reviews and Sam Merwin reviewing the books. So if you have a spare quarter, get a copy of And now, about Howard Browne. He is a huge man, made up almost entirely of vast enthusiasms. We have known Howard intimately for about six years and we continue to regard him with awe. There is no middle ground with this man. When he likes something, it's terrific If Howard hung a picture in his office we doubt if it would be a casual chore. The hammer he used would be a terrific hammer. The tack he drove would outshade other tacks by five country miles. And the picture? Gad, what a masterpiece! Seriously, one has only fo view Browne's enthusiasm for living to know it for what it is -- a priceless gift. He has written unnumbered short stories and, under the name of John Evans, is the father of near future. We have watched him write several of his stories and he hurled himself into each with a zeal and a zest that sfunned us into a partial paralysis. So we give you Howard Browne, a hard fellow to classify ; an astounding mixture of Balzac, a ten-ton dynamo, and Peter Pan. But this above all -- a great guy.  seemed not so much indications of defiance as they did the result of some terrible and deepseated shock, \"Let's go over it again, Cordell,\" Kirk said. The young man swallowed audibly against the silence. One of his hands twitched, came up almost to his face as though to shield hiseyes, then dropped limply back. \"That light -- \" he mumbled. \" -- stays on , # Kirk said briskly. # The quicker you tell us the answers, the quicker we all relax. Okay?\" Cordell shook his head numbly, not so much in negation as an effort to clear the fog from his tortured mind. T told you,\" he cried hoarsely. \"What rpofe do you want? Yesterday I told you the whole thing.\" His voice began to border on hysteria. \"What good's my trying to tell you if you won't listen? How's a guy supposed -- \" \"Then try telling it straight!\" Kirk snapped. \"You think you're fooling around with half-wits? Sure ; you told us. A crazy pack of goof-ball dreams about a blonde babe clubbing two grown people to death, then disappearing in a ball of blue light! You figure on copping a plea on insanity?\" \"It's the truth!\" Cordell shouted. \"As God hears me, it's true!\" Suddenly he buried his face in his hands and long tearing sobs shook his slender frame. O ne of the other men reached out as though to drag the young man's face back into the withering rays of the spotlight, but Kirk motioned him away. Without haste the Lieutenant fished a cigar from the breast pocket of his coat and began almost leisurely to strip away its cellophane wrapper. A kitchen match burst into flame under the flick of a thumb nail and a cloud of blue tobacco smoke writhed into the cone of hot light. \"Cordell,\" Kirk said mildly. Slowly the young man's shoulders stopped their shaking, and after a long moment his wan, tearstained face came back into the light. \"I -- I'm sorry,\" he mumbled. Kirk waved away the layer of smoke hanging between them. He said wearily, \"Let's try it once more. Step by step. Maybe this time... He let the sentence trail off, but the inference was clear. An expression of hopeless resignation settled over Cordell's features. \"Where do you want me to start?\" \"Take it from five o'clock the afternoon it happened.\" The tortured man wet his lips. \"Five o'clock was when my shift went off at the plant. The plant, in case you've forgotten, is the Ames Chemical Company, and I'm a foreman in the Dry Packaging department.\" \"Save your sarcasm,\" Kirk said equably. \"Yeah. I changed clothes and punched out around five-fifteen. Juanita had called me about four and said to pick her up at Professor Gilmore's laboratory,\" # At what time?\" \"No special time. Just when I could get out there. We were going to have dinner and take in a movie. iN'o particular picture; she said we'd pick one out of the paper at dinner \" \"Go on . # \"Well, it must've been about quarter to six when I got out to the University. I parked in front of the laboratory wing and went in at the main entrance. I walked down the corridor to the Professors office. His typist was knocking out some letters and there were a couple of students hanging around waiting for him to show up. How about a smoke, Lieutenant?\" Kirk nodded to one of the men behind him and a package of cigarettes was extended to the man under the light. A match was proffered and the young man ignited the white tube, his hands shaking badly. The Lieutenant crossed his legs the other way. \"Let's hear the rest of it, friend.\" \"What for?\" Bitterness tinged Cordell's voice. \"YoU don't believe a word I'm saying.\" \"Up to now I do \" \"Well. I said something or other to Alma -- she's the Profs secretary -- and went on through the door to the hall that leads to the private lab. When I got -- #  K irk held up a hand. \"Wait a minute. Your busting right in on the Professor like that doesn't sound right. Why not wait in the office for your wife?\" \"What for?\" Cordell squinted at him in surprise. \"He and I get... , got along fine. When Juanita first went to work for him he said to drop in at the lab any time, not to wait in the outer office like a freshman or something.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Well... The young man hesitated. \"We're back to the part you don't believe, Officer. I can't hardly believe it myself ; but so help me, it's gospel. I saw it!\" \"I'm waiting.\" Cordell said doggedly: \"The lab door was open a crack. I heard a woman's voice in there, and . it wasn't my wife's. It was a voice like -- like cracked ice. You know: cold and kind of... well... brittle and -- and deadly. That's the only way I can describe it. \"Anyway, I sort of hesitated there, outside the door. I didn't want to go bulling in on something that wasn't none of my business... but on the other hand I figured my wife was in there, else Alma would've said so.\" \"You hear anything besides this collection of ice cubes?\" ' The young man's jaw hardened. \"I'm giving it the way it happened. You want the rest, or you want to trade wise cracks?\" One of the men behind Kirk lunged forward. \"Why, you cheap punk -- \" Kirk stopped him with an arm. \"I'll handle this, Miller.\" To Cordell: \"I asked you a question. Answer it.\" \"I heard Professor Gilmore. Only a couple words, then two quick flashes of light lit up the frosted glass door panel. That's when I heard these two thumps like when somebody falls down. I shoved open the door fast... and right then I saw her!\" Kirk nodded for no apparent reason and was careful about knocking a quarter inch of ash off his cigar. \"Tell me about her.\" The young man's hands were shaking again. He sucked at his cigarette and let the smoke come out with his words : \"She was clear over on the other side of the lab... standing a good two feet off the floor in the middle of a big blue ball of some kind of -- of soft fire. Blue fire that sort of pulsed -- you know. Anyway, there she was: this hell of a good-looking blonde ; looking right smack at me, and there was this funny kind of gun in her hand. She aimed it and I ducked just as this dim flash of light came out of it. Something hit me on the side of the head and I... well, I guess I blanked out.\" \"Then what?\" \"Well, like I said yesterday, I suppose I just naturally came out of it. I'm all spread out on the floor with the damndest headache you ever saw. Over by the window' is the Prof and -- \" he wet his lips -- \"and Juanita. They're dead. Lieutenant; just kind of all piled up over there... dead, their heads busted in and the -- the -- the -- \" H e sat there, his mouth working but no sound coming out, his eyes staring straight into the blazing light, the cigarette smouldering, forgotten, between the first two fingers of his left hand. Almost gently Kirk said: \"Let's go back to where you were standing outside the door. You heard this woman talking. What did she say?\" Cordell looked sightlessly dowm at his hands. \"Nothing that made sense. Sounded, near as I can remember, like: 'Twelve times zero' -- then some words, or more numbers maybe -- I'm not sure -- then # she said, 'Chained to a two hundred thousand years' -- and the Professor said something about his colleges having no idea and he'd warn them -- and the blonde said, 'Three in the past five months' -- and then something about taking in washing -- \" ' The detective named Miller gave a derisive grunt. \"Of all the goddam stories! Kirk, you gonna listen to any -- \" Kirk silenced him with a gesture. \"Go on, Cordell\" The young man slowly lifted the cigarette to his mouth, dragged heavily on it, then let it fall to the floor. \"That's all. That's when the lights started flashing in there and I tried to be a hero.\" \"Sure you've left nothing out?\" \"You've got it all. The truth, like you wanted.\" Kirk said patiently, \"Give it up, Cordell. You're as sane as the next guy. Give that story to a jury and they'll figure you're trying to make saps out of them -- and when a jury gets sore at a defendant, he gets the limit. And in case you didn't know: in this State, the limit for murder is the hot seat!\" The prisoner stared at him woodenly. \"You know I didrPt kill my wife -- or Professor Gilmore. I had no reason to -- no motive. There's got to be a motive. The police officer rubbed his chin reflectively. \"Uh-hunh. Motive. How long you married, Cordell?\" \"Six years.\" \"Children?\" \"No.\" \"Ames Chemical pay you a good salary ?\" \"Enough.\" \"Enough for two to live on?\" \"Sure\" \"How long did your wife work for Professor Gilmore?\" \"Four years next month.\" \"What was her job?\" \"His assistant.\" \"Pretty big job for a woman, wasn't it?\" \"Juanita held two degrees in nuclear physics.\" \"You mean this atom bomb stuff?\" \"That was part of it.\" \"Gilmore's a big name in that field, I understand.\" Kirk said. \"Maybe the biggest.\" \"Kind of young' to rate that high, wouldn't you say? He couldn't have been much past forty.\" Cordell shrugged. \"He was thirty-eight -- and a genius. Genius has nothing to do with age, I hear.\" \"Not married, I understand.\" \"That's right...\" A slow frown was forming on Cordell's face. \"How old was your wife?\" Kirk asked. The frown deepened but the young man answered promptly enough. \"Juanita was my age. Twenty-nine.\" Martin Kirk eyed his cigar casually. \"Why,\" he said, \"did you want her to walk out on her job; to give up her career?\" Cordell stiffened. \"Who says I did?\" he snapped. \"Are you denying it?\" \"You're damn well right I'm denying it! What is this?\" K irk was slowly shaking his head almost pityingly. \"On at least two occasions friends of you and your wife have heard you say you wished she'd stay home where she belonged and cut out this 'playing around with a mess of test tubes? Those are your own words, Cordell.\" \"Every guy,\" the young man retorted, \"who's got a working wife says something like that now and then. It's only natural.\" Kirk's jaw hardened. \"But every guy's wife doesn't get murdered.\" The other looked at him unbelievingly. \"Good God,\" he burst out, \"are you saying I killed Juanita because I wanted her to stop working? Of all the -- \" \"There's, more!\" snapped the Homicide man. \"When you passed Professor Gilmore's secretary in his outer office yesterday, what did you say to her?\" \" 'Say to her?' \" 'the, prisoner echoed in a dazed way. \"I don't know that #... Some kidding remark, I guess. How do you expect me to remember a thing like that?\" \"I'll tell you what you said,\" Kirk said coldly. \"It goes like this: 'Hi, Alma. You think the Prof's through making love to my wife?' \" Cordell's head snapped back and h!s jaw dropped in utter amazement. \"What! Of all -- ! You nuts ? I never said anything like that in my life! Who says I said that?\" Without haste Kirk slid a hand into the inner pocket of his coat and brought out two folded sheets of paper which he opened and spread out on his knee. \"Listen to this, friend,\" he said softly. \" 'My name is Miss Alma Dakin. I reside at # Monroe Street, and arn employed as secretary to Professor Gregory Gilmore. At approximately # : # on the afternoon of October #, Paul Cordell, husband of Mrs. Juanita Cordell, laboratory assistant to Professor Gilmore, passed my desk on his'way into the laboratory. I made no effort to stop him, since my employer had previously instructed me to allow Mr. Cordell to go directly to the laboratory at any time without being announced.' \" Kirk looked up at the man in the chair opposite him. \"Okay so far?\" t Paul Cordell nodded numbly. \" 'At the time stated above,' \" Kirk continued, reading from the paper, \" 'Mr. Cordell stopped briefly in front of my desk. He seemed very angry about something. He said, \"Hi, Alma. You think the Prof's through making love to my wife?\" Before I could say anything, he turned away and walked into the corridor leading to the laboratory. I continued my work until about five minutes later when Mr. Cordell came running back into the office and told me to call the police, that Professor Gilmore and Mrs. Cordell had been murdered. \" 'Since there is an automatic closer on the corridor door, I did not see Mr. Cordell enter the laboratory' itself. I do \"know, however, that Professor Gilmore and Mrs. Cordell w r ere alone in the laboratory less than ten minutes before Mr. Cordell arrived, as I had just left them alone there after taking some dictation from my employer. Since I went directly to my desk, and since there is no entrance to the laboratory other than through my office, I can state with certainty that Mr. Cordell was the only person to enter the laboratory between #:# that afternoon and # : # when Mr. Cordell came out of the laboratory and told me of the murders. \" 'I hereby depose that this is a true and honest statement, to the best of my knowledge, that it was given freely on my part, and that I have read it before affixing my signature to its pages. Signed: Alma K. Dakin.' \" T here was an almost ominous crackle to the document as Lieutenant Kirk folded it and returned it to his pocket. Paul Cordell appeared utterly stunned by what he had heard and his once stiffly squared shoulders were slumped like those of an old man. \"I don't have to tell you,\" Kirk said, \"that the only window in that laboratory is both permanently sealed and heavily barred. No one but you could have murdered those two people. You say you saw them killed by some kind of a gun. Yet a qualified physician states both deaths were caused by a terrific blow from a blunt instrument We found a lot of tilings around the lab you could have used to do the job -- -but nothing at all of anything like a projectile fired from a gum\" The prisoner obviously wasn't listening, \"B -- but she -- she lied!\" he stammered wildly. \"All I said to Alma Dakin was a couple of words -- three or four at the most -- about not working too hard. Why should she put me on a spot like that? I just -- don't -- get -- it! Why should she go out of her way to make trouble... Dawning suspicion replaced his bewilderment. \"I get it! You cops put her up to this; that's it! You need a fall guy and I'm \"Listen to me, Cordell,\" Kirk cut in impatiently. \"You knew, or thought you knew, your wife was having an affair with Professor Gilmore. You tried to break it up, to get her to leave her job. She wasn't having any of that; and the more she refused, the sorer you got. Yesterday you walked in on them unannounced, found them in each other's arms, and knocked them  both off in a jealous rage. When you cooled down enough to see what you'd done, you invented this wild yarn about a blonde in a ball of fire, hoping to get off on an insanity plea.\" \"I want a lawyer!\" Cordell shouted. Kirk ignored the demand. \"You're going back to your cell for a couple hours, buster. Think this over. When you're ready to tell it right, I want it in the form of a witnessed statement, on paper. If you do that, if you co-operate with the authorities, you can probably get off with a fairly light sentence, maybe even an outright acquittal, on the old 'unwritten law' plea. I don't make any promises. Gilmore was a prominent man and a valuable one; that might influence a jury against you. But it's the only chance you've got -- and I'm telling you, by God, to take, it!\" Cordell was standing now, his face working. \"Sure; I get it! All you're after is a confession. What do you care if it's a flock of lies? My wife wouldn't even look at another man, and not you or anybody else is going to make me say different. That blonde killed them, I tell you -- and I'll tell a jury the same thing! They'll believe me; they're not a bunch of lousy framing cops! You'll find out who's -- \" Lieutenant Martin Kirk wearily ground out his cigar against the chair rung. \"All right, boys. Take him back upstairs.\" Chapter II I T was a gray chill day late in November, and. by #:# that afternoon the ceiling lights were on. Chenowich, the young plainclothes man recently transferred to Homicide from Robbery Detail, stopped at Martin Kirk's cubbyhole and slid an evening paper across the battered brown linoleum top of the Lieutenant's desk. \"This oughta interest you # he said, jabbing a chewed thumbnail at an item under a two-column m  the left # s er of Wife and Atom Wizard .  , was today Criminal Court Justice P.

A jury last week found Cordell uilty of the brutal slayings despite his testimony that it was a mysterious blonde woman, floating in a \"ball of blue fire,\" who had blasted the victims with a \"ray gun\" on that October afternoon. Ignoring the \"girl from Mars\" angle, alienists for the prosecution pronounced the handsome defendant sane, and his attorneys were powerless to offset the damage. The final blow to Cordell's hopes for acquittal, however, was administered by the State's key witness, Alma Dakin, Gilmore's former secretary. For more than three hours she underwent one of the most cal courtroom ,  .  Kirk shoved the' paper aside. \"What could he expect when he wouldn't even listen to his own lawyers?

Asked for you personally. \"What about?\" \"She won't say. All I get is it's important and she talks to you or nobody.\" \"What's her name?\" \"No, sir. Not even that... Want me to get rid of her?\" Kirk eyed the mound of paper work on his desk and sighed. \"Probably a taxpayer. All right; send her back here.\" A moment later the patrolman loomed up outside the cubbyhole door, the woman in tow. Lieutenant Kirk remained seated, nodded briskly toward the empty chair alongside his desk. \"Please sit down, madam. You wanted to see me?\" \"You are Mr. Kirk?\" A warm voice, almost on the husky side, \"Lieutenant Kirk.\" \"Of course. I am sorry.\" . ful about Kirk stared was worth for a voluptuous by exactly the right margin. Her face was more lovely than beautiful, chiefly because of large eyes so blue they were almost purple. Her skin was flawless, her blonde hair worn in a medium bob fluffed out, and hersmooth fitting tobacco brown suit must have been bought by appointment. She looked to he in her mid-twenties and was probably thirty. Her expression was solemn and her smile fleeting,, as was becoming to anyone calling on a Homicide Bureau. She placed on a corner of Kirk's desk an alligator bag that matched her shoes and tucked ple yellow gloves the color of her blouse under the bag's strap. Her slim fingers, ringless, moved competently and without haste. a I am Naia North, Lieutenant Kirk.\" \"What's on your mind, Miss North?\" She regarded him gravely, seeing gray-blue eyes that never quite lost their chill, a thin nose bent slightly to the left from an encounter with a drunken longshoreman years before, the lean lines of a solid jaw, the dark hair that was beginning to thin out above the temples after thirty-five years. Even those who love him, she thought, must fear this man a little. Martin Kirk felt his cheeks flush under the frank appraisal of those purple eyes. \"You asked for me by name, Miss North. Why?\" \"Aren't you the officer who arrested the young man who today was sentenced to die?\" Only years of practise at letting nothing openly surprise him kept Kirk's jaw from dropping...You mean Cordell?\" \"Yes.\" \"I'm the one. What about it? What've you got to do with Paul Cordell?\"... Naia North said quietly, \"A great deal, I'm afraid. You see, I'm the woman who doesn't exist; the one the newspapers call 'the girl from Mars.'\" It was what he had expected fronuher first question about the case. Any murder hitting the headlines brought at least one psycho out of the woodwork, driven by some deep-seated sense of guilt into making a phony confession. Those who were harmless were eased aside; the violent got detained for observation. But Naia North showed none of the signs of the twisted mind. She was coherent, attractive and obviously there was money somewhere in her vicinity. While the last two items could have been true of a raving maniac, Kirk was human enough to be swayed by them. \"I'm afraid,\" he said, \"you've come to the wrong man about this, Miss North.\" His smile was frank and winning enough to startle her. \"The case is out of my hands; has been since the District Attorney's office took over. Why don't you take it up with them?\" H er short laugh was openly cynical. \"I tried to, the day the trial ended. I got as far as a fourth assistant, who told me the case was closed, that new and conclusive evidence would be necesI exolf date, ive him new \"We met sever a! fell in love, I #... and after tired of play in wanted him his secretary promavoided me.\" wanted me to write a letter.

Not that I'll enjoy being a public spectacle, but at least they'll give me some action.\" \"What do you want done?\" She put both elbows on the desk and bent toward him. He caught the faint odor of bath salts from under the rounded s of her blouse. \"That man ieutenant.

You know that nobody could have gone into that laboratory without her seeing them. You know that Alma Dakin testified that there were only two people in there: Gilmore and Juanita Cordell.

I'll admit I hadn't intended to -- to spy on Greg. But I kept waiting for him to say or do something that would prove or disprove he was in love with Juanita Cordell, and not until his secretary left and he was alone with her did I discover what was between them.

He said something particularly nasty to me and I grabbed up a short length of shiny metal from the workbench and hit him across the side of the head before lie knew what was happening.

He started to lunge across the. room at me and I threw the thing I was holding at hiim It struck him and he fell down. My only thought was to hide, for I realized I couldn't go out through the outer office, and the only window was barred. So I hid in that closet again. \"It was onlya few minutes before Paul Cordell regained consciousness. He staggered out of the room and down the hall and I could hear a lot of excited talk and Greg's secretary calling the police. Then I didn't hear anything at all for a moment, so I came out of the closet and looked down the hall. The office door was closed, but it seemed so quiet in there that I tiptoed quickly to the inner door, opened it a crack and peered through. The office was deserted; evidently Cordell and Miss Dakin had gone out to direct the police when they showed up. \"When I saw there was no one in the main hall of the building itself, I simply walked out and left by another exit. No one I passed even noticed me.\" F or a long time after Naia North had finished speaking, Martin Kirk sat as though carved from stone, staring blindly into space. She knew he was thinking furiously, weighing the plausibility of what he had heard, trying to arrive at some method of corroborating it in a way that would stand up in a court of law. \"Miss North.\" She came out of a reverie with a start, to find the Lieutenant's eyes  boring Into hers. \"This shiny hunk of metal you used : where is it now?\", \"Fra sure I wouldn't know. Probably some place in the laboratory, unless somebody took it away. I do seem to remember picking it up and tossing it back with several others like it on the bench.\" \"Then it's still there,\" he said slowly. \"Judge Reed ordered the room sealed up until after the trial. And then there's the closet... , . Were you wearing gloves that afternoon, Miss North?\" She said, \"No. You're thinking of fingerprints?\" \"If you're telling the truth,\" he said, \"there's almost certain to be some of your prints on the inside of that closet door -- maybe even on that length of metal, if we can find it.\" She said almost carelessly: \"That's all you'd need to clear Paul Cordell, isn't it?\" \"It would certainly help.\" He swung around in the chair, scooped up the telephone and gave a series of rapid-fire orders, then dropped the instrument on its cradle and turned back to where she sat watching him curiously. He said, \"A few things I still don't get. Like this business of your standing two feet off the floor in a ball of blue light. And the flashes of light just before Cordell heard his wife and Gilmore fall to the floor. Even the snatches of conversation he caught while still in the hall. He couldn't have dreamed all that stuff up -- at least not without some basis.\" She had opened her bag and taken out a cigarette. Kirk ignited one of his kitchen matches and she i bent her head for a light. He could see the flawless curve of one cheek and the smooth cap of blonde hair, and he resisted the urge to pass a hand lightly across both. Something was stirring inside the Lieutenant -- something that had long been absent. And, he reflected wryly, all because of a girl who had just finished confessing to two particularly unpleasant murders. Naia North raised her head and their eyes met -- met and held. Her lips parted slightly' as she caught the unmistakable message in those gray-blue depths... The moment passed, the spell was broken and she leaned back in  the chair and laughed a little shakily. \"I read about those statements of his in the papers, Lieutenant. I think perhaps I can at least partially explain them. As I remember it, there were several Bunsen burners lighted on the laboratory bench near that window'. They give off a blue flame, you know, and I must have been standing near them when Paul Cordell came charging in. In his confused frame of mind, he may have pictured me as being in a ball of flame.\" \"Sounds possible,\" the man admitted, frowning. \"What about those flashes of light?\" \"You've got me there. Unless they were reflections of sunlight through the window -- from the windshield of a passing car, perhaps.\" \"And the things he heard you and Gilmore saying?\" She shook her head regretfully. dark, I She went wit. in cruisers a hand slowly of his neck, 'He could have conof metal in your hand as a gun,...

Why the confession?\" She said soberly: \"I was so sure they'd let him off. When you know someone's innocent you can't realize that others won't know it too, I But when I learned he'd been found guilty and actually condemned to die... well, I know it sounds noble and all that but I couldn't let him go to his death for d done.

Then Kirk was all right again, and he was looking at a woman who had just confessed to murder. You heard the phone call I made a moment ago, Miss North. Two men from the Crime Lab are already on their way to the University. If they find your fingerprints inside that closet, if they can. turn up anything to prove you've been in Gregory Gilmore's laboratory, then you and that evidence and your confession get turned over to the D.

It was nearly nine, o'clock in the evening, and 'both of them were showing signs of wear. Kirk left his chair and went over to the water and two cupfuls brought one back to the girl.

A male stenographer from Ms staff was' called in and Naia North dictated a complete statement which she signed. Troy questioned her for nearly two hours, getting in every possible angle of her private life as well as minute details of her actions on the day of the Kirk had not been present durin that part of the night, but he ured it wouldn't be much from what he'd heard many time; He mixed himself was surprised to discover hands were I Well, why not?

But no stranger than the girl herself. Now how about that? Why should he think her strange? Because she'd taken a life or two? Hell, lots of people did that and no one called them strange. Criminal or unmoral or greedy or angry, yes. But not strange. She looked like other women -- only a lot better. She dressed like them, walked like them, talked like them. So why strange? Because she was strange. Nothing you could put your finger on made her that way, but that's the way she was. He threw his cigar savagely into the fireplace. He went over and made another drink and poured it down fast and another one after it, right on its heels. Then he went to bed. Tomorrow -- today, rather -- was a work day and work days were tough days and he needed his rest. He didn't get much of it, though. The phone woke him a few minutes after seven o'clock. It was Arthur Kahler Troy at the other end and the IX A. was too angry to be coherent. It seemed Naia North had disappeared from her locked cell during the night. fifiT don't give a triple-distilled J, damn what you say!\" Troy snarled. \"Nobody's got enough money to make that kind of payoff. Five men,. Lieutenant -- five men and five locked doors stood between that girl and the street. And you sit there and try to tell me somebodybought all five of 'em off!\" \"Then,\" Kirk said heatedly, \"what's your explanation?\" It had been going on this way for over an hour. The morning sun came in weakly at the window behind Troy's huge polished mahogany desk, picking up random reflections from the collection of expensive gadgets littering the glass top. Troy began to wear another path in the moss-colored broadloom carpeting. He was big and broad and getting puffy around the middle, like a one-time halfback going to seed. His round, heavyfeatured face was even more .florid than usual, and his heavy growth of reddish-blond hair needed a comb. Martin Kirk pushed himself deeper into the depths of a brown leather chair and watched the D. A. through brooding eyes. He wanted a cigar but it was too early in the morning for that kind of inYou needed a breakfast and a couple cups of coffee before -- \"I don't explain it,\" Troy said in quieter tones. He was standing by the window now, staring down into the boulevard passing that side of the Criminal Courts Building. \"It's one of those tilings that make me think my sainted mother wasn't so wrong when she used to tell z elves and gnomes and I I chauns and fairies and -- # Kirk made a sound deep in his throat, \"Naia North was a hell of a long way from being a leprechaun. Somebody wanted her out of here for some reason -- and they got her out. I want to know who took her out, why she was taken, and where she is now. And I'm going to find out the answers to all three if I have to turn this town on its ear.\" \"Go ahead,\" Troy said, \"Hop right to it and I wish you luck. Only leave me and my people out of it.\" \"Seems to me you're mighty damned anxious to be left out.\" Arthur Kahler Troy turned on his heel and strode toward the Lieutenant until he was towering over him. \"just what,\" he said between his teeth, \"do you mean by that crack?\" \"Figure it out for yourself,\" Kirk snapped. \"And I'm sure you can.\" Troy reared back as though the police officer had pulled a gun on him. \"Why -- why you -- I'll have you busted for making a dirty insinu -- \" \"You couldn't bust a daisy chain at the police department,\" Kirk growled. \"The Commissioner hates your guts and you know that as well as I do. Now let's cut out all this hokey-pokey and pick up a few loose ends. The first thing: what about Paul Cordell?\" All the wide-eyed fury seemed to go out of Troy's face like water down the bathtub drain. He turned away and walked slowly back to his desk chair and sat down. He said, \"What about Cordell' in a soft voice. \"The morning paper,\" Kirk said, \"reports he was taken up to Hillcrest last night. The warden out there's probably got him in Death Row already.\" \"Uh-hunh.\" \"Well, let's get him out of there. With the evidence we've got, plus Naia North's sworn statement, Judge Reed will have to bring him back down here and release him -- at least on bail until we can find the girl. The man's innocent, Mr. D. A.; have you forgotten?\" \"Yes.\" \" 'Yes'? Yes, what?\" \"I've forgotten he's, innocent,\" Troy said quietly. \"Matter of fact, he's guilty as hell\" T he lieutenant half rose from his chair. \"Now wait a minute! You heard that girl's story and you've got the evidence I turned over to you right here in this office last night. What more -- \" \"I'll tell you what more' Troy snapped. \"That girl was a fraud, her story was a downright lie and that evidence was faked. Let me tell you something else, Mister: within five minutes after the guard downstairs reported your girl friend missing, I had five squads of my men out running down the personal information she gave me a few hours before. And you know what they found out?. Every bit of what she told me was false! Hear that? False!

You didn't want any part of this new development from the minute I called you on the phone last night. You knew it could show you and your whole organization as a bunch of bunglers and inyou got rid of the that without her the of those murders would never et out to the voters. it won't work. Fatso!

He drummed his fingers over and over on the arm of his chair and listened to the every-day sounds of a normal day at the Homicide Bureau. A new day, a new set of problems, and why knock yourself out over some tiling that doesn't concern you? Thing to do was go down to the comer tavern and have a couple of fast ones and watch an old movie on television. Yes sir, that's exactly what he'd do! He went back to the mimeographed pages. For the fourth time he read through Cordell's testimony of what had happened that October afternoon. And it was there that he came across the first possible break in the stone wall. Once more Martin Kirk went over the few lines, although by this time he could have come close to reciting them from memory. It was an excerpt from Arthur Kahler Troy's cross-examination of the defendant after Cordell's counsel, in a last desperate effort to swing the tide of a losing battle, had placed him on the stand. Q: (by Troy) : Now, Mr. Cordell, I direct your attention to the point in your testimony at which first entered Professor Gilmore's outer office. At what time was this? A: At about #:# p.m. Q: Who was in the office at that time? A: Alma Dakin, the Professor's secretary. And a couple of students -- although , they were at the other end of the room and I didn't pay much attention to them . Q: But you did pay attention, as you call it, to Miss Dakin? A: Well, I spoke to her, if that's what you mean. Q: That's exactly what I mean, Mr. Cordell. And what was it you said to her? A: Something about it was too late in the day to be working so hard. Q: That was all? A: Yes, sir. Q: Remember, Mr. Cordell, you're under oath. Now I ask you again : Was that all you said to her at that time? A: Yes, sir. Q: It isn't possible you've forgotten some additional remark? Think carefully, please. A: No, sir. That's all I said. I swear it. Q: Very well. Now how well do you know Miss Dakin? A: Just to speak to, Q: Have you ever seen her outside Professor Gilmore's office? A: No, sir. Q: Ever ask her for a date? A: 'No, sir. Q: Did you ever have an argument with her? A discussion of any kind that may have become a bit heated? A: No, sir. Q: Then to your knowledge she'd have no reason to dislike you? A: No, sir. Q: Very good. Now, Mr. Cordell, I want to read to you an excerpt from the testimony given by Miss Dakin in this court. \"Mr. Cordell was looking very angry when he came in. He came up to me and bent down over the desk and said so low I could hardly hear him: 'Hi, Alma. You think the ProPs through making love to my wife?' \" I now ask you, Paul Cordell, isn't that what you said to Alma Dakin? Not that shewas working too hard, or whatever it was you claimed to have said. A: No, sir. I didn't say anything like she said I did. I wouldn't insult my wife by saying such a thing to a third -- Q: Just answer the questions, Mr. Cordell. Then you contend that Miss Dakin deliberately lied in her testimony. A: She was mistaken. Q: Oh, come now! Miss Dakin is an intelligent girl; she couldn't misunderstand or twist your words to that extent. Now could she? A: Then she lied. I never said anything like that. Q: What reason would she have for lying, Mr. Cordell? By your own statement she hardly knew you, always greeted you pleasantly on the times you came to the office, never got into any arguments with you, and never saw you outside the office. She had worked for Professor Gilmore for five or six months, has excellent references, and is well liked by her friends. Yet you're asking us to believe that she coldly and deliberately lied to get you into trouble. Is that true? there all thought grimly, was innocent, then id the truth during the if he had told the truth to Alma Dakin, then, automatically, Alma Dakin's testimony was untrue. Kirk ran his fingers through his in a gesture of bafflement. What possible reason could Gilmore's secretary have for going out of her way to lie about Cordell's remark? Was it because she was so certain he had killed her employer that she wanted to make sure he would be punished? Or was it because she wanted to shield the real killer? Maybe she was a friend of Naia North's and had known the blonde girl was in Gilmore's laboratory all along. She might even have deliberately steered everyone out of her office after Cordell discovered the bodies, making it possible for Naia to slip out unseen. was a slender lead, but the y one large enough to get even ngernail grip on.

When Miss Slife had run down, Kirk said, \"This Dr. Karney. Why did Miss Dakin leave him?\" The woman' at the other end of the wire seemed astonished by Kirk's ignorance. \"Why, I assumed everybody knew about Dr. Karney. He died of a heart attack about eight months ago.\" What!\" U , there's no need shout, Mr. Kirk.

Once more Lieutenant Martin Kirk went back to  analyzing the broken phrases Cordell had picked up while eavesdropping that October afternoon.

Kirk bit thou corner of his own any colleges an warnin word was college , where he ha le ference to the man in the street, but to the Professor... Wait a minute! Not colleges! Colleagues! It was his colleagues Gilmore had promised to warn. And the word meant men and women in the same line of work as the Professor -- nuclear physics. Things, Kirk told himself with elation, were looking up! The business about \"three in the past five months\" was next, but he felt sure of what that had meant. But the last of the quotations wnt nowhere at all. \"Something about taking in washing -- \" Under less tragic circumstances, a nonsense line. But Cordell hadn't actually heard the words clearly enough to quote them with authority. That could mean he had heard words that problem,\" Kirk explained carelessly. \"Let's say you hear a guy talking in the next room. You can't really make out the words he's saying, but right in the middle of his mumbling you hear what sounds like 'taking in washing.' Now you know that can't be right, so you try to think out what he actually did say... It was obvious Chenowich had fallen off on the first curve, so completely off that Kirk didn't bother finishing what was much too involved to begin with. The patrolman was staring at him in monstrous perplexity. \"Jeez. Lieutenant. I don't get it. 'Less the guy's goin' to open up one of these here laundries. That way he'd be takin' in washinh But I don't know what else -- \" sounded like \"taking in washing.\" Taking, baking, making, slaking, raking -- the list seemed endless. \"Washing\" could have been the first two syllables of Washington -- and Washington would be the place where the Atomic Energy Commission hung out. Still too hazy. He leaned back and put his feet up and attacked the three mysterious words from every conceivable angle. No dice. S ight of the ambling figure of Patrolman Chenowich passing the office door caught his eye, reminding him that two heads were often better than one. \"Hey, Frank.\" Chenowich came in. \"Yeah, Kirk's feet hit the floor with a solid thump and he grabbed Chenowich's wrist with fingers that bit in like steel. \"Say that again!\" he shouted. \"Say it just that way!\" The patrolman recoiled in alarm. \"What's got into you, Lieutenant? Say what?\" \"Taking in washing!\" \"Takin' in washin'? What for?\" Kirk's grin threatened to split his face. \"The same words,\" he said, \"but you say them different. Only . your way's the right way! Thanks, pal. Now get out of here!\" Chenowich went. His mouth was still open and his expression still troubled, but he went. The last of the killer's cryptic remarks was now clear. For Kirk reLieutenant. Somethin' doin'?\" \"Fin trying to figure out a little alized that \"takin' \" rhymed with words you'd never associate with \"taking.\" \"Bacon\", for instance -- or \"Dakin\" S Alma Dakin, former secretary to two widely separated, and now dead, nuclear scientists. Her name had been mentioned by the slayer of Professor Gilmore only seconds before she had clubbed the savant to death. But now that \"taking\" had come out \"Dakin\" -- what did the rest of the phrase mean? Dakin in washing made no sense. What sounded like washing? Washing; washing... watching? It was close; in fact nothing he could think of came closer. right Dakin in watching ; no. Dakin is watching -- that made sense. But Alma Dakin hadn't been watching anything at the time of dell, was at her desk in the outer office. That would leave Dakin was watching as the right combination. Watching for the right opportunity for murder I  What did it mean? Well, assuming from her past record that Alma Dakin was mixed up in the deaths of two prominent men of science, it argued that she and Naia North were accomplices in a scheme to rid America of her nuclear fission experts. The nice smooth story of quited love was probably as much a lie as the personal information Naia North had given Arthur Kahler Troy. The North girl had confessed to murdering Gilmore and Juanita Cordell. As a confessed killer she must be taken into custody and booked on suspicion of homicide. Taking her was Martin Kirk's job -- and it seemed he had a contact that would lead him to her. Namely Alma Dakin. Lieutenant Kirk grabbed his hat and went out the door. Chapter V T he address for Alma Dakin turned out to be a small threestory walk-up apartment building on a quiet residential street near the outskirts of town. At two in the afternoon hardly anyone was visible on the sidewalks and only an occasional automobile passed. Kirk parked his car half a block further on down and got out into the chill November air. He entered the building foyer and looked at the name plates above the twin rows of buttons. The one for Alma Dakin told him the number of her apartment was #C. He pushed the button several times but without response. The foyer was very quiet at this time of day, and he could hear the faint rasp of her bell through the speaking tube. Kirk was on the point of shifting his thumb to the button marked superintendent when a sudden  thought stayed his hand. It was not the kind of thought a conscientious, rule-abiding police officer would harbor for a moment. The lieutenant, however, was fully aware he had no business working on a closed case to begin with -- and when you're breaking one set of rules, you might as well break Cv u? T  # C# other bells inner door it open, he voice floated Who is it?\" ma'am. was , green or otherwise, alor the street curbing, but Kirk figured wouldn't know that Why, n , no, I can't inline -- tt Okay. Sorry we bothered you, Kirk' let the door swing into place hard enough to be heard upstairs. But this 'time he was on the right side of it. There was a moment of silence, then he caught the sound of retreating feet and a door closed. Without waiting further, the Lieutenant mounted the stairs to the third floor, his feet soundless on the carpeted treads. The entrance to #G was secured by a tumbler-type lock. From an inner pocket Kirk took out a small flat leather case and a thin-edged tool from that. Working with the of the expert, he the door moulding near inserted the tool blade the bolt. This he  turned the door hanlater, was standing room tastemodem woods, was to enter the tlie door . In case at an mopporbe half way i while she was still en eased with lock. moulding back would be nothin ithin ten minutes Kn: every living room in search of somethin anything, that would point to Dakin as being more than a nine to-five secretary. And secretary found nothing, no one, not even the girl who lived here, could tell that an intruder had been at work. The bedroom seemed even less promising at first. Dresser drawers gave up only the pleasantly personal articles of the average young woman. Miss Dakin, it turned out, was almost indecently fond of frothy undergarments and black transparent nightgowns -- interesting but not at all important to the over-all problem. Kirk, his search completed, sat down on the edge of the bed's footboard and totaled up what he had learned. It didn't take long, for he knew absolutely no more about Alma Dakin than he fore entering her apartment personal papers, no letters yearning boy friend in t home town, no savings ing-account scrawled line of mas greetings the apartment's To Kirk's lack of such highly significant her bavin his already strong suspicion of her was solidified into certainty of her guilt. But certainty was a long way from rock-ribbed evidence -- and that was something he must have to proceed further. He was ready to leave when it dawned on him that he had not yet looked under the bed. Kneeling, he pushed up the hanging edge of the green batik spread and peered into the narrow space. Nothing, not even a decent accumulation of dust. The light from the window was too faint, however, to reach a section of the floor near the footboard. Kirk climbed to his feet and attempted to shove that end to one side.  The bed failed to move. He blinked in mild surprise and tried again. It was only by exerting, almost his entire strength that he was able to shift the thing at all, and then no more than a few inches. He felt his pulse stir with the thrill of incipient discovery. Once he made sure nothing was anchoring the bed to the floor, he began to tap lightly against the wood in an effort to detect a possible false panel. Within two minutes he located an almost microscopic crack in the headboard cleverly concealed by a decorative design running along the base. He ran his fingers lightly i along the carvings until they encountered a small projection which gave slightly under pressure. Kirk pressed down harder on the knob. A tiny click sounded against the silence and a section of wopd some three feet square swung out. Lifting it aside, the detective found himself staring at an instrument board of some kind with a series of buttons and dials countersunk into it. The board itself formed a part of what was obviously a machine of some sort which evidently contained its own power, for there seemed to be no lead-in cord for plugging into a wall socket. It could, Kirk thought, be a short wave radio transmitter. If it was, it looked like none he had ever , come across before. On the other hand it could be some sort of infernal machine, ready to blow half the city to bits at the turn of a dial. E ven as his mind was weighing the advisability of tampering with the thing, his fingers were reaching for the various controls. Gingerly he moved one or two of the dials but nothing happened. A little more boldly now, he began to depress the buttons. As the third sank in, a low humming sound began to fill the room. Before Kirk could find a cut-off switch of some kind, the faint light of day streaming through the room's one window winked out, plunging him into a blackness so infinitely deep that it was like being buried alive. Nothing can plunge a man into the sheerest panic like the absence of light. Even a man like Martin Kirk, who had walked almost daily with danger for the past fifteen ' years. And since the form panic takes varies with the individual, the Lieutenant's reaction was an utter inability to move so much as a finger.

The humming note came back, then ceased -- and without warning daylight from the window washed over the bewildered and thoroughly frightened police officer. Not until five minutes had passed was Martin Kirk sufficiently in control of his nervous system to even attempt replacing the loose panel in the headboard. When at last he managed to do so, he returned the bed to its original position, closed and bolted the kitchen one last look around to make sure nothing was out of place, out of the apartment, time he was back behind I of his car and had cigar, Kirk's brain function with some' ability.

That machine, mind that could gether a mechanism not of this planet. Paul Cordell's story floated in a ball of blue fire soun like the ravings of a brain. And the seeming miracle Naia North's escape from a cell block now passed from fantasy to the factual. What to do about it? Martin Kirk, at this moment undoubtedly the most bewildered man alive, put his head in his hands and tried to reach a decision. Take his story to the Police Commissioner? It would r mean a padded cell -- and without even bothering to see if Alma Dakin possessed a machine more complicated than an electric iron. Some government agency? By the time the red tape was unsnarled the former secretary could have reached Pakistan on foot. Slowly from the depths terror of the Unknown, Kirk's training in police proce began to make itself started to form -- hazy at in a sharp and orderly # to the of his bad cisive orders duced the ; of almost the law. It sister livside of town who put her up for traveling bag in one fist, hour was gone in response to a skidded a a stop at the curb a block e building. He delivered a dictograph to his superior, listened a grim warning to keep his mouth shut about this at Headquarters, asked a couple of questions that drew no answers, and departed as swiftly as he had come. The next step was the dangerous one. The superintendent admitted Kirk to the Dakin apartment and went down to the. foyer to ring the bell in case the girl arrived at the wrong time. He soothed the Lieutenant's anxiety somewhat by explaining that she seldom returned the place before seven o'clock, over three hours from now, but Kirk was taking no chances. y five o'clock he had Alma s bedroom  bugged and the working order and He was painsremoving all traces of sawdust and bits of the dresser cover the diefoyer and #D to take up He was in the s room, workin ,, earphones in he heard, the sound o; door closing in the next a The time was #:#. Chapter t was like being in her room with his eyes shut. The soft scraping of drawers opening and closing, the creak of a chair being sat in, the cushioned thump of shoes dropped to the carpeted floor, even the rustle of a nylon slip as she drew it over her head. It seemed much too early for her to turn in for the night. Was he going to be forced to sit there and listen to twelve or fourteen hours of feminine snoring? It would be damned unlikely in view of what was a cinch to be running through her mind, f Minutes later he heard her leave the bedroom, followed the muted roar of a shower. After that had laste mal length of time ceased and naked on the bedroom, more opening ; ers, the whispe donned, and sound like lass which he part of the If there was anything of a panicky nature in her movements it would take better ears than his to detect it. But for Alma Dakin to get away with her kind of job required the nerves of lion trainer no matter what pressures she was subjected to. Kirk stretched his legs, dug a cigar from the breast pocket of his coat and got it burning, then went back to the crossword puzzle with half his attention, keeping alert for any significant sound from the other apartment. His years as a minion of the law had adequately conditioned him to the utter boredom that went with the ordinary stake-out. Several times the subject left the bedroom, but he was able to pick up sounds familiar enough to trace as emanating from the living room or kitchen. But nothing she did was worthy of notice in the home-town paper or even on the margin of a police blotter. A t #:# Alma Dakin again entered the bedroom. A hunch, or a sixth sense, or whatever years of experience in a single field gives a man, told Kirk that this time something would pop. He put aside the newspaper, placed a sheet of blank paper on the cover of a historical romance lifted from the spinster's nightstand, and got out a pencil, A motor whined unexpectedly from the opposite side of the apartment wall and he could hear a heavy object roll with well-oiled smoothness a short distance across the carpet. He decided it was the bed being moved out from the wall by mechanical means rather than muscle, and it was clear to him now how she was able to get at that hidden radio, or whatever it was. For the second time that day Kirk heard that eerie humming -- a sound, he realized, that ordinarily would have been completely inaudible beyond the girl's bedroom walls. Suddenly the hum was chopped off and a familiar voice spoke familiar words. I \"Mythox. Contact established. Proceed.\" \"A message for Orin. Alma Dakin\" A series of almost undetectable clicking sounds; then: \"Alma?\" Despite the fact that the voice was coming through an amplifier, there was no distortion. \"Anything wrong?\" It was a man's voice, clear, vibrant, young, and with no trace of an alien accent. Kirk's theory' of an interplanetary' menace lost some of its strength. \"I -- I'm not sure, Orin,\" the girl said hesitantly. \"There was a policeman at my apartment today -- the same one Naia went to; The building superintendent told me,\" \"That's odd. There's no way you can be tied in with her. Or is there ?\" \"Not that I know of, Orin. Unless they've decided to check back on me just for the sake of some-, thing to do. If that's what's happened and they've learned I was working for Dr. Karney at the time of his death, they may get an idea the three deaths are related. And once a police officer gets suspicious, he can hound you unmercifully. That's what worries me, Orin. You know Fm not really an accomplished liar!\" . I \"Shall we bring you here? At least long enough to build you a new identity?\" A pause. Then the girl's voice again: \"Something else puzzles me, too. There's no mention of Naia's confession in the newspapers.\" \"What? You mean they haven't released Cordell? What will Tamu say?\" \"If they have, nobody knows about it. I told you Naia should have remained in their hands until the young man was set free. You don't know my people as I do. Orin -- none of you do.\" \"But the evidence? Nobody, not even the most stupid of Earthmen, could have ignored that evidence! Tamu won't like this.\" \"I can't help it, Orin. I keep telling you, Orin: you must use a new set of standards for this world. If its people thought as yours do, none of these unpleasant things would have to happen.\"  A nother pause before the man's voice came over Kirk's earphones. \"We didn't dare leave Naia in their hands. That's why we brought her back here. Look at the chance we took by permitting them to hold her even briefly. If only she hadn't blundered in the first place... \" His voice trailed off, then came back suddenly brisk. \"Well, too late for regrets. We won't risk letting them question you. Field Seven in, say, three hours. Time enough?\" \"More than enough!\" Her relief was unmistakable. \"It'll be wonderful visiting Mythox again, Orin. I hope Methu will allow me to stay for a long time.\" t \"I hope so too, darling. But our work comes first; none of us dares let down for even a moment... See you soon. And don't neglect to eliminate the contrabeam.\" \"It will be gone seconds after we break contact. Field Seven at -- let's see -- #:#.\" \"I'll be there. Farewell, Alma.\" The dim humming came back again, followed briefly by no sound at allf Then there was the noise of drawers being opened and closed with a kind of brisk and cheerful haste. Alma Dakin was preparing to take it on the lam! , Martin Kirk knew he had only a limited time to plan his own course of action. One way was to walk into the adjoining apartment, place Alma Dakin under arrest and force the whole story from her. A moment's reflection, however, caused him to abandon the idea. Any such move would end his chances of getting his hands on Naia North. More than anything else he wanted her, and he closed his mind to the broader aspects of what had taken -- and was still taking -- place. No, his job was to follow Alma Dakin to her rendezvous with this man Orin and in some way force the two of them into turning Naia North over to him. This time she'd stick around long enough to stand trial -- even if he had to handcuff her to the bars of her cell ! From beyond the wall he .caught the sounds of suitcases being snapped shut, followed by the fading echo of footsteps. He jerked the earphones from his head and went quickly to the hall door in time to catch a glimpse of Alma Dakin on her way to the building stairs, a bulging suitcase in each hand. Kirk raced for the kitchen of #D, flung open the door and went down the rear steps with astonishing agility. He was opening the door of his car by the time the girl came out of the front entrance. He watched her place the bags in the trunk of a small sand-colored coupe, then slip in behind its wheel and start the motor. The coupe passed his parked car, turned the corner and disappeared. Before it had reached the next intersection, Kirk was rolling smoothly half a block to her rear. Two hours later both cars were moving along a winding country road miles from civilization. Kirk was driving without lights, bad enough under favorable circumstances but sheer folly considering the sky was completely overcast, so that he was denied even the faint radiance of the stars. Fortunately there was no other traffic in this desolate section at eleven o'clock at night, so that his only danger was in failing to remain on the twisting road. in ally, , near the crest of a particularly steep hill, two flaring red lights warned him his quarry was applying the brakes of her car. He cut ins engine long enough to hear the coupe's motor die, then he swung his wheel to the right and coasted to a halt on the soft shoulder of the road. Under cover of bushes and trees, naked of foliage at this time of the year, Kirk worked his way silently ahead until' he could make out the dim figure of the girl as she dragged the pair of bags from the boot. Without a backward glance, she turned away from the road and an instant later was lost to sight among the trees. There was nothing of the frontiersman in Lieutenant Martin Kirk, but fortunately the same was true of Alma Dakin. Where anyone accustomed to moving across natural terrain could have lost the officer with ease, in her case he need only pause briefly from time to time and use his ears. At last the seemingly interminable forest ended and the girl sank wearily down on an upended suitcase. Kirk, perspiring freely under the folds of his topcoat, halted in the shelter of a' tree bole, and waited. Beyond where the girl sat was a large natural clearing covered with a fringe of winter grass. The silence was close to being absolute; only the faint keening of a chill wind and the restless creak of barren branches kept it from becoming unbearable. Gradually his eyes became more and more accustomed to the absence of light worthy of the name, and he began to identify objects as something more than formless na er :te. the akin appeared to  him than he had d her slim back I when she lighted vind bringing the co to his nostrils, he lv have strangled her torture. by.

He was through in # out on a windv hill like tire night air abc and he was starin circular structure as Before the Lieutenant could get his jaw off his necktie, Alma Dakin had uttered a cry of relief and was racing toward the nearest edge of the gleaming vessel. A panel in its side slid noiselessly back and the tall figure of a man was outlined in the opening. \"Alma!\" he shouted and sprang to the ground to meet her. They came together almost violently midway between the clearing's edge and the ship. She clung to him as he bent his head to meet her lips. Kirk glanced past them at the open portal. Dim light from within cast a soft glow against the night. Nothing moved in the narrow segment of the interior visible from where he was standing. And Kirk had a moment of what was as close to fear as he was able to know. A little time of bewilderment when his guard slipped just a trifle. What in the hell was all this? Into his solid world had come strange and unreasonable things. Crazy ships, and people who didn't play according to the rules he had learned over thankless drudging years as an honest cop. A few tiny beads of sweat formed on his upper lip. Then Ms stubborn, inherent fatalism came to his aid. He grinned without humor. The hell with it. Whatever came up -- a screwball flying saucer or a berserk psycho waving a gun. You played it the same; according to your own rules. This thing, whatever it was, bridged the gap to a killer. And when you found such a bridge, you crossed it. M .rtin kirk, his gun clutched tightly, movedlike a casual shadow, eased his way along the hull of ship and slipped inside. He had never seen anything like this. The lighting for one thing. It came from nowhere and somehow the stuff had a mood. It seemed alive -- an intelligent force watching him, mocking him, sneering at him. And so potent was the mood of the whole setup, so sharp his need of release that he muttered, \"The hell with you,\" and softly followed a circular corridor which curved off the hull. They were coming toward the ship, Orin and Alma -- coming while he still hunted a hole. He kept on going. If he met anybody they were going tago down. But he didn't. He found a steel stairway and a pocket at its base to hold his body. It wasn't a dark pocket. Light was everywhere. But the stairway hid him and the pair passed by and went on down the corridor. He realized his right hand was aching and relaxed his grip on the gun butt he clutched. He straightened up and the tense little mirthless grin played on his lips. Okay. Now where was she and howdid it work? Could he find her and haul her off silly tilt-awhirl? He thought not. Either his eyes were bad or this thing had appeared from nowhere. Something inside snapped: Quit thinking that way! Whatever it looked like -- think right. Follow the rules. Look for the dame. His grin deepened. Sure. He started walking. Around the eerie corridor in the direction opposite that taken by Orin and Alma Dakin. He walked a long time and there were no doors or anything else so the only thing to do was keep walking. He thought: When I come to that stairway I'll be back where I started but where's that? What good is a hall you keep going around and around in? The ship lurched and threw him to the floor. It was going somewhere. But it didn't go anywhere. Of that he was sure. Maybe he'd been fooled but it seemed the ship settled back after that single lurch and lay there like a choice segment out of someone's pet nightmare. Kirk got to his feet and rubbed the place his leg had violently met the floor. He walked on and there was the steel stairway again and it was all very damned silly because he knew he'd circled the times. But lucky because the footsteps sounded again and as he dived toward the pocket, the wall of the ship opened to form a doorway. They forgot something, he thought. What kind of supermen are these? They can build a ship that has a stairway every third trip around and still they go away and forget things,  The grin 'was tighter than ever. Whistle in the dark, boy, but admit it -- you're scared. Sure, but what's that got to do with it? . Orin and Alma left the ship. Martin Kirk pushed his head around the staircase. He crouched ship at least three  for sometime, staring through the open segment of the hull at the outside world. And his poor stupid orthodox mind asked a pitifully logical question: How could it get light, with the sun at high noon, in fifteen minutes? After a long, motionless time, the silence became such a roaring thing in Kirk's ears he could stand it no longer. He got up and walked to the doorway. Something had gone somewhere; either the ship or the world he'd known, because out there was a different world and he knew damn well he'd never seen it before. M artin kirk stepped out into a circle of lush vegetation. And in doing so, he learned something. He learned that the human mind is a far more adaptable mechanism than most people imagine; that they can pelt you with goof balls and you get sweat on your iip and have to talk to yourself to keep from sliding off your rocker, but after a while when your mind seems halfway over the edge, it straightens up suddenly and starts going along. A defense mechanism against insanity? He didn't know. He only knew that when the tiger roared, he whirled around with his gun leveled, saw the sixinch teeth, got wholesomely and sanely scared, and then everything was all right. He knew he was all right when he got the right reaction from sight of the almost naked girl holding the tiger. For a long moment it was a frozen-action tableau. The huge orange and black beast. The wide eyed young brunette nudist, and the tropical forest with the great big fart sun overhead. The girl's voice nailed it all down. \"Don't be afraid. Rondo won't hurt you.\" Kirk's resentment flared warmly and, had resentment been a tangible thing, he would have kissed it. \"You're tootin' right he won't, sister. This isn't a toy Fm holding.\" \"Rondo is very gentle.\" Kirk eyed the girl. \"Why don't you put some clothes on?\" Her teeth were as bright and even as little white knives but her smile took the edge off them. \"Only people in the city wear clothes. I wear them when I'm in the city. When I come out here I -- \" \" -- you don't wear any clothes. Tell me -- where am I?\" \"Don't you know?\" \"Let's not play games. If I knew f wouldn't ask you.\" \"Did you come on the ship?\" \"You saw me get out of it didn't you? Now answer my question.\" And he realized how certain he was of what her answer would be. \"On Mythox.\" \"Well fancy that. 'Now tell me something else. Do you know what  language you're speaking?\" \"Of course. English.\" \"And why should you speak English on Mythox? Haven't you got a language of your own?\" \"Certainly. Rut you're obviously from Earth. I thought you were a Watcher. I tried English. If you hadn't responded I'd have spoken to you in the other Earth languages.\" \"How many do you know?\" I \"Eleven hundred and seventeen. With various dialects, four thousand and -- \"  \"There aren't that many.\" She looked puzzled. Then her face cleared. \"Oh you mean Earth languages. I was referring to those of the Five Galaxies.\" I'm not going to be surprised at anything, he told himself doggedly. Not at anything. \"Do you know anyone named Naia North?\" T here was a childlike seriousness in her manner. It tended to deny the maturity of her body. Or was it the other way around? Martin Kirk wasn't sure, and grimly assured himself that he didn't give a damn. The girl said, \"I don't know anyone by that name. But I could find her for you.\" \"How would you go about it?\" \"I'd go to the city and check the video-directory, naturally.\" \"Naturally. And you'd put your clothes on before you went?\" \"Of course I would. We go without clothing only out here in the playground.\" Kirk realized he'd been holding the gun rigidly in front of him. The tiger had dropped to the ground and lay outstretched like a lazy, good-natured dog. Kirk lowered the gun, setting his eyes again on the girl. \"A minute ago you said you thought I was a Watcher. What did you mean?\" He would have framed his questions with more guile, but something told him it wasn't necessary. This child of nature was utterly without guile. She said, \"An Earth Watcher. What did you think I meant?\" \"I didn't know or I wouldn't have asked.\" It clarified. Dakin is watching. Sure. What the hell else would a Watcher do but watch? But why, and for what? Kirk was mystified. But it didn't matter, he asserted inwardly, and turned his mind back to the straight line. The cop's line. \"Will you put on your clothes and go into the city and locate Naia North for me?\" \"If it will help you\" \"It will. Where can I wait for you?\" \"If you want to see Naia North why don't you come with me?\" Kirk shrugged. Why not? So long as the score was completely unknown to him, why not follow the path of least resistance? \"Get your clothes on,\" he said. The girl turned and started leading the tiger back toward a grove of trees. After a few steps she turned back, a look of sober thought on her face. \"Are all Earthlings so assertive?\" she asked. Kirk grinned. As long as it works, this one is, baby. But what if it stops working? His reply was not audible and the girl turned finally to disappear into the bushes. Kirk then experienced a strange feeling of unreality which persisted until the girl returned. TVT Y name is Raima,\" the wore tight-fitting trousers, a loose blouse and had a silver colored air car with room in back for the tiger. Kirk knew it was an air car whc;i the craft lifted from the ground from no apparent means of acceleration and skimmed along just above the trees. He sat beside Raima and asked, \"About that ship I came here in? How fast does it travel and how far is it from Mythox to Earth?\" \"The distance is around two hundred thousand light years but the ship doesn't really travel at all.\" \"Maybe you could go into a little more detail,\" Kirk said wearily. \"It's very simple. Distance, as you Earthlings regard it, is not distance at all. Space bends to a greater or lesser degree depending upon its immediate function in whatever time-space equation you are using.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Kirk replied and silently added: Keep to the line. Hold to your own values. On Earth, wherever it is, a J  r man is waiting to go to the chair for a murder he didn't commit. Use whatever equation you want to -- that still adds up the same. These people may be a lot smarter than you are, but they can't twist that one and make you believe it comes out anv different. A strange city of graceful flying spirals was coming over the horizon. It moved closer and the air car arced in to a halt on a huge cement landing area punctuated with small circles of a different material. Raima jumped from the cockpit .s ear the soft paws landing ? ent over and the circles. in the city and image wi.

Now a slight frown creased the lovely Naia's brow. \"A little perhaps. How did you get to Mythox? And why did you come?\" \"A slight matter of murder. A murder you confessed to, or has it slipped your mind?\" \"Aren't you being rather absurd? That's all done with.\" \"Not so far as Paul Cordell is concerned. He's going to the only he isn't.

The main thing for you to remember, is this: You may be as smart as all get out but you broke an American law on American soil by your own confession and by God you're going back and answer for it!\" \"Idiot!

Now' you sneer in my teeth. What do you use for a rudder, sweetheart.\" \"I followed orders,\" Naia flared with a mixture of anger and sullenness. \"I am now free of the assignment.\" Kirk pursed his lips thoughtfully. \"You wouldn't be sort of a hatchetwornan for this high-blown outfit would you? I can think offhand of a few other names. Karney, Blatz, Kennedy. What gives with knocking off nuclear physicists, baby?\" Naia did not answer. When she started to turn away from the mirror , Kirk glanced at the silent Raima standing with her hand on the tiger's head. \"Is there any way I can call on the lady in the mirror personally?\" \"Not if she doesn't want to receive you,\" Raimu said. She was studying Kirk with wistful dark eyes. ' Naia turned back quickly. \"Fll be glad to receive you. It's time I taught you a lesson.\" \"Fine. What's your address?\" But Naia was gone. The little mirror turned opaque. Kirk shot a questioning glance at Raimu. \"Does yes mean no on this cockeyed planet?\" \"Her car will come.\" Raimu murmured. But the petite dark beauty seemed interested in other things. \"You didn't tell me your name.\" \"Sorry. Rude of me. It's Martin Kirk. You've been pretty nice to me. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation,\" \"You're going to see Naia North?\" \"Yes. She's a murderess. I'm taking her back to my planet.\" \"I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.\" \"You too, honey?\" Kirk reached out and flicked one of the raven curls. \"If things were different you and I might be able to have fun.\" \"I spend a lot of time -- where you found me. Maybe -- \" \"I doubt if I can make it. But keep your clothes on after this -- as a personal favor to me.\" She was the very soul of solemnity. \"I don't understand you. I really don't understand you at all.\" At that moment, an air car --  much smaller than Raimu's, dropped gently into the street beside Kirk. \"Good lord! Did this thing smell me out?\" \"It came to the mirror on Naiads private wave-length. Get in. It will way. The mocking smile was still on take you to her.\" her face. \"Did you trip?\" Kirk crawled into the car. The Kirk got groggily to his feet. \"No, last thing he saw before it lifted into angel. That's the way I always cross the air, were Raimu's dazzling a room.\" As he came upright his black eyes. The last words he heard hand reached toward the bulge were, \"Goodbye. Martin Kirk. I made by his shoulder holster. Rut will visualize you.\" it didn't get that far. The car swung up above the He had not seen from whence graceful, spidery buttresses and the first blow came but that was moved across the city. Kirk filled not true with the second.

We got a date with Arthur Kahler Troy.\" He was really cagey this time. When the light beam shot out, he hurled himself to the side. But he could have saved the effort. A beam came from the other door jamb and he stepped right into it. That one really tore his head off. S omebody was talking. It was a man and he had a deep resonant voice: a voice full of authority -- and censure. \"Im surprised at you Naia. I never suspected you of having a sadistic streak.\" Naia's sullen reply. \"Do you think anyone can do the work I do and remain unmarked?\" \"I suppose not. But as I remember it, you asked to serve.\" \"As a benefit to humanity.\" \"We won't go into it.\" But Naia pressed the point. \"I have always followed orders. I placed myself in possible jeopardy on Earth by clearing Paul Cordell.\" \"But Paul Cordell was not cleared.\" \"Not through any fault of mine.\" \"But why this? What end does torturing this poor unfortunate serve?\". Martin Kirk cautiously opened one eye. It brought to his brain the image of a large blue globe, A man of fine and commanding appearance stood within the globe, suspended about a foot from the floor. The globe and the man gave every indication of having just come through the opaque glass wall of the room, and as Kirk watched, the man was lowered slowly to the floor and the globe became a blue mist that spiralled lazily and was gone. Kirk opened both eyes now, stirred, and climbed dizzily to his feet. \"You bump into the damndest tilings around here,\" he said. \"But let's get down to the important business. My name is Martin Kirk. I'm an American police officer. One of your subjects committed a murder on American soil. I hope you aren't going to be difficult about extradition.\" The other could not hide his surprise. Nor did he try to. \"Amazing,\" he murmured. Then, \"I am Tamil, the overlord of the galaxy. I wonder if Naia's cruelty hasn't affected your mind?\" \"If you mean I'm nuts, I think maybe you're right. But it wasn't little Playful here who did it. I've gone through a lot and I don't speak with any sense of bragging. I've seen more furiny things happen than any one man should see in so short a time. So maybe I am off my rocker. So I'd like your permission to take my prisoner back to Earth so I can give all my time to regaining my sanity.\" Tarau regarded Kirk with thoughtful eyes. \"I think we should have a talk.\"  \"I would like a talk. I would like nothing better than to chew the fat with you for hours on end if my jaw didn't hurt so damned much. So PH just take my prisoner and go. Do I have to sign a paper or something?\" The overlord's surprise was fast becoming a kind of fascinated awe. \"Kirk, you said?\" He pointed to the door leading to the inner room. \"Please go in, sir. There's no use of our standing out here while we discuss your problem.\" The Lieutenant eyed the door frame warily. \"I tried getting through there before but the light got in my eyes!\" \"You can trust me.\" The police officer stepped cautiously through the opening and on into a luxuriously furnished room. Tamu, dressed much the same as one of Earth's better bankers, followed him in and suggested he sit down. \"Why?\" Kirk demanded bluntly. \"Let's stop kitten-and-micing around, Mr. Tarnu. I'm not comfortable here and I want to leave. With her.\" He tilted his head toward the watching, sullen-faced Naia North. \"And now.\" Tamu said, \"Believe me, it will be as easy for you to return to Earth an hour from now. You seem weary to the point of exhaustion. I ask you again: sit down and get back some of your strength. Naia will find you something to eat.\" Kirk's stubborn determination to force an immediate showdown wavered. It had been born largely of fear to begin with, and  the thought of relief for his burning throat was impossible to resist. \"I could use a drink,\" he admitted. Tamu gestured and Naia North turned to leave the room. But Kirk leaped forward to block her off. \"Nothing doing! I don't take my eyes off you, baby. I'll just pass up that drink.\" The girl glanced at the overlord and shrugged helplessly. Tamu said, \"Have a girl bring in something. While we're waiting I suggest all three of us get comfortable.\" While Naia was speaking into a tiny screen set into one of the silkcovered walls, Tamu and the man from Earth sat down across from each other on a pair of fragilelegged chairs. The overlord leaned back and sighed. \"You've asked my leave to return to Earth and to take Naia back with you to stand trial for murder. Have you considered that I may refuse that permission?\" \"I don't think I have to consider it,\" Kirk said promptly. \"You don't?\" Tamu was mystified again. \"Why not?\" \"You tell me you're the overlord. I take that to mean you're in charge. That means you have laws to govern your people and that means you believe in laws. One of your subjects has broken the law of my country. You can't refuse to let her take the consequences any more than if the situation was reversed.\" Tamu was shaking his head and smiling slightly. \"I'm afraid you're not taking into consideration on fact, Mr. Kirk. Naia North broke your law, as you call it, on express and definite instructions from me.\" Martin Kirk made a show of astonishment. \"Let me get this straight. You ordered Professor Gilmore and Juanita Cordell murdered? Is that what you're telling me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" ' \"Exactly the reason I suggested we have a talk. To make you see why they -- and others in the same classification -- could not be allowed to live.\"  , ' \"Men like Karney? Kennedy? Blatz?\" Tamu blinked. \"My respect for you increases, Martin Kirk.\" \"Don't let it throw you. I'm a police officer, and police officers are trained to do the job right.\" The overlord crossed his legs and settled deeper into the chair. \"Mythox needs men like you, Martin Kirk. That is why I'm going to give you a chance for life. For this you must understand: if I wanted it, you would be dead within seconds.\" A chill slid along the stubborn back of the Lieutenant but nothing showed in his impassive expression and he did not speak. \"But because we do need you, I am going to tell you things no Earthman knows. I believe that once you understand why Mythox has undertaken to meddle in the affairs of another world -- and I tell you frankly that our doing so is as abhorrent to us as anything you can imagine -- once you understand our reasons, you will cheerfully, even eagerly, join us,\" \"And if I don't?\" . \"You know the answer to that, A I'm sure.\" A slim fairhaired girl in a pale green toga-like dress entered the room carrying a tray holding tall glasses of some sparkling blue beverage. She offered it first to Kirk, then the others. The Lieutenant removed one of the glasses, wajted until Tamu and Naia had done the same, but not until they had drunk some of the liquid did he tilt his own glass. The cold tangy liquid hit him like a bombshell -- a bombshell on the pleasant side. He could almost literally feel his strength flow back, his senses sharpen and the poisons of fatigue and mental strain disappear. \"I'm listening,\" he said. Tamu set his glass on the edge of a nearby table and bent forward, his manner earnest. \"It won't take long. Martin Kirk. Hear me. We of Mythox are far in advance of the peoples of Earth -- both spiritually and scientifically. Life on our plhnet materialized in much the same manner as on your own world, but countless ages before. Almost the same process of evolution took place ; but somewhere along the line humanity on 'Mythox managed to reach full development without the flaws of character found among so many of Earth's inhabitants. When I tell vou that we find it almost impossible to voice an untruth, that taking a human life willfully for any reason is equally difficult, that crime of any nature is almost unknown here -- then you will see the difference between the two planets ... have ob place on a method for from terrene to managed to ht years of  worlds as we of years ago we control of your .ay we might choose.

So long as Earth's peoples confined their more destructive tendencies to themselves we kept our hands off -- even while we failed to understand such I ' senseless conduct. \"And then one day we witnessed an explosion on. Earth's surface -- an explosion different from any of the countless ones before it. That explosion was the first man-made release of atomic energy -- a process we had known how to bring about' ages, but one we would never use.

If they persisted down that path, it was bound to follow that they would attempt the thing we feared : the splitting of hydrogen atoms -- the hydrogen bomb, as you call it. \"We know what that would mean: a chain reaction that would wipe out an entire galaxy in one blinding flash. Our galaxy , Martin Kirk -- yours and mine! Do have any thought at all on that means?\" The question was even ecu. head, the overlord \"Mythox and grains of dust on aa s stars ant! planets wide and # Me countless other number of not always, know it, but thoroughly as we do our own. Fortunately for our purpose only a relative few have progressed along a line which can lead to danger for the rest. Yours is one of those which has -- and that is why we of Mythox have taken a well-masked place in your affairs so far as they relate to nuclear physics. \"Every scientist of your world, male or female, is constantly under the eye of a Watcher. These Watchers are members of your own races -- people we have enlisted in the fight to save not just their world \"When a W atcher learns a physicist is close to the one key to success in his effort to make a hydrogen bomb -- an equation that begins: 'Twelve times zero point seven nine' -- we are notified and a killer from our own people is sent to execute that scientist. Yes, Martin Kirk, we have those among us -- a very few -- who are capable of killing on orders and for cause. Naia, here, is one of them. She was sent to take the lives of Gregory Gilmore and Juanita Cordell; but she bungled and instead of their deaths resembling heart failure, they were obviously murdered. \"Alma Dakin tried to cover up the truth by making it appear both scientists had died at the hands of a jealous husband. She succeeded, both because of her perjured testimony and the fact that Paul Cordell insisted on telling the truth. But when we of Mythox learned what had happened, Naia was sent back to confess the crime. She entered the laboratory only a few hours before she came...to your office; while she was in the laboratory the second time, the clues you found were put there. \"Our mistake was in thinking that, once proof was offered clearing Cordell, the innocent man would be freed. For once more we credited Earthlings with the same code of ethics we of Mythox adhere to. \"You succeeded in following Naia here. Only a man composed of equal parts of Earth bulldog and genius could have done so. Martin Kirk, I offer you a place among us and a lifetime devoted to making sure the galaxy of which we both are a part does not perish. What say you?\" Several minutes dragged by. The eyes of both Tamu and Naia North were glued, to the grim visage of Homicide Lieutenant Kirk. It was impossible for either of them to know what thoughts were churning behind that stone face. Abruptly he stood up. \"I'm a cop. I leave your kind of problem to the people who are good at it. My people, Tamu. You see, I belong to my world, not to yours. \"But you've got a solid argument -- one I'd be a fool not to consider. Let me sleep n it. Tomorrow morning we'll talk about it some more; then I'll give you my answer. Right now I'm too worn out to think in a straight line.\" \"Of course.\" The overlord rose to his feet. \"Find Martin Kirk comfortable quarters, Naia, and leave orders he is not to be disturbed until he is ready to join us.\" On his way down a corridor behind the same slip of a girl who had brought him his drink, Martin Kirk was thinking: They didn't even frisk me for a gun! Martin Kirk went into his apartment and lay for a while looking at the ceiling. After a time, he got up and went out again. Chapter IX T he soft silvery radiance which this planet seemed to feature, bathed the metal hallway as Kirk marched stolidly toward the slim arcing stairway that led toward Naia's floor. This was certainly a strange building, he thought. The architects of Mythox knew how to use curves. They utilized them for utility and beauty to a point where a straight line was something to be surprised at. Pretty smart people, the Mythoxians -- in more ways than one. And Kirk, for no apparent reason, thought of a phrase comnion among children during his own childhood. \"Who died and left you boss?\" He counted the markings over one door. He had seen those markings before. Naia North lived here. And Naia North was in. Kirk walked softly across the large foyer room and quietly pushed open a door to the left. Naia, clad as always, in beauty, lay sleeping on a bed that stood out from the wall on two narrow rods of metal and needed no other support. As Kirk opened his mouth, Naia awakened, so she was looking calmly at him as he spoke. \"Up, baby. You've got a date with a hot electrode a lot of light years from here. It's a hike, so rise and shine.\" , Naia sat up very slowly, very gracefully. She was what men dream of finding in bed beside them. What they marry to keep in bed beside them. \"You must be mad\" \"As a hatter, baby. Into your duds.\" He saw her glance at the door jamb of the bedroom entrance, saw the shadow of disappointment in her lovely eyes. \"You didn't put those Joe Louis light rays in your bedroom, did you?\" Naia set her feet on the floor and drew herself to her full height. She wore light blue, a gown that hung as had that of Guinevere, as that of the Maid of Shalot. But Naia was contempt. She was contempt clothed in cold blue then contempt naked as she allowed the gown to fall to the floor. A few minutes later, she was contempt clothed for the street in tight britches and a loose blouse. \"You go first,\" Kirk said. \"And do as you're told. You may be a Mythoxian, but this .# doesn't know that. It puts big holes in anybody.\" As Naia walked serenely toward the hall door, there was only a touch of sullenness at the comers of her mouth. She turned her head to speak over her shoulder. \"Hiding ' behind a t woman, brave Earthman?\" \"Yes and no. I'm hiding behind a woman from those damn straightleft rays, and Pm not a brave Earthman. I spend most of my time scared to death. That's why all of us are getting back to Earth quick, so I can draw an easy breath,\"  \"All of us?\"  \"Oh yes. Didn't I tell you? Yoii're taking me to the places I can find Alma Dakin and Orin. We're going to have witnesses and testimony. And the party who gets burned isn't going to be Paul Cordell.\" \"I won't -- \" \"Hold it, honey.\" Kirk had picked up two items upon leaving Naia's apartment. A pair of filmy silk stockings and a white scarf. He jerked Naia's hands behind her back in somewhat of a surprise move. Before she recovered, her wrists were tightly bound. She gasped, \"You -- madman,\" just before he deftly pulled the scarf across her mouth and twisted it into an effective gag. He stepped back to admire his handywork. \"Now we're all ready. Orin and Alma.\" Naia shook her head in a slow' negative. Kirk pushed her gently into the hall and rounded to face her. \"Yes, baby,\" he said. \"You ought to know now I won't be stopped. I need Orin to fly that space buggy. If I don't get him we can't go. Then there'd be nothing left for me to do but even the score for Paul Cordell. He'll have to go but you'll keep him company.\" Naia stood like ' a statue, apparently considering. Then she moved slowly down the corridor in the opposite direction from which Kirk had come. Down three curving flights and stopping finally in front of a door identical to her own. L Kirk stepped forward and leaned firmly on the knob. The door opened. He knew where the bedroom was in these apartments now. He pushed Naia ahead of him, into the bedroom and saw Alma lying with her eyes dosed. Kirk whirled, just in time to level his gun and bring Orin to a dead stop. \"Over by the bed, high-born.\" As Orin complied, Kirk leered at Naia. \"That was clever, but I had it doped. I spotted them for husband and wife or the Mythox equivalent quite some time back. A good chance shot to hell.\" \"What do you want here?\" Orin demanded. \"A chauffeur. We're heading Earthward on the first ship. That's the one out in the jungle.\" \"But you talked to Tamu. I thought -- \" \"I'd been suckered? No no my friend ! On the force they called me the boy with the one-track mind.\" \"I can see what they meant,\" Orin sighed. \"I thought you would. Tell your wife to get dressed. We're getting an airsled.\" \"You might have the decency to -- \" \"I won't turn my back. You can stand between us. That's the best I can do.\" A lma dressed swiftly in a costume similar to Naia's. When they were ready to leave, Kirk said, \"Now let's get it straight once and for all. I'll stand for no fast moves. It's Earth or some quick slugs. Do you follow me?\" Theydid not speak but they evidently believed Kirk because, fifteen minutes later, the party of four stood beside the ugly ship while thick trees and grasses whispered around them. \"Inside.\" In the corridor, Orin stopped and turned as though having thought of a convincing argument he was bent upon trying. Kirk poked him sharply in the ribs with the barrel of the .# and he moved on after the women toward the ladder and thence to the motor room. Once inside, Orin turned and spoke sharplv. \"Won't you reconsider?\" \"Push the levers, jack. The right ones.\" \"Tamu is a reasonable man. We could talk to him again. He would make even a more generous offer.\" \"I'm waiting.\"  \"Certainly you did not refute the logic of his argument? We are in the right. Our case is just. The galaxies must be protected from -- \" \"The right levers, Jack.\" \" -- from those who through ignorance, stupidity,' or ferocity would destroy it.\" \"One more minute of .this and there'll be dead people aboard this ship.\" \"You're helpless, really. You can't fly this ship without me. Therefore my life is safe. I merely refuse to launch it.\" \"Would you like a dead wife?\" Orin whitened perceptibly. \"She may be a wife to you, but to me she's just a doll who helped lie a man into the chair.\" \"You wouldn't do it! You haven't got the nerve to shoot down a man or a woman in cold blood.\" Kirk looked steadily into Orin's eyes. \"You don't believe that do you, hud?\" Orin held the gaze for a long time. Then he dropped his eyes. \"No. I don't believe it.\" \"Then get to work.\" \"One last offer. Won't you reconsider. Join us?\" \"No!\" \"Very well.\" And Orin, a fixed, taut look on his face, reached forth his hand and touched a button on the panel board. It was a very special button. A button for use only when all hope was gone. The exploding space-time ship lighted the countryside to blinding    A.P.

What do you want to go to the moon for?\" \"Sure, why you wanna go? What they got on the moon we aint got right here?\" There was general laughter from the dozen or so who sat eating their lunch in the shade of Building B. They all thought that was a pretty good one. Good enough to repeat. \"Sure, what they got on the moon we ain't got here?\" But Joe Spain wasn't in the rnood for jokes. He burned with even greater conviction and stood up as though to harangue the workers. \"You wanta know why I got to go to the moon? Why I've got to get on that ship? Then PH tell you. It's 'cause I'm a little guy -- that's why! Joe Spain -- working stiff -- one of the great inarticulate masses.\" More laughter. \"Where'd you get those big words, Joey? Out of a book?

He'd expected to get by, but it was one of the calculated risks tiiat could have stopped him cold. Once inside the building, he put the bag into his locker and went to work. He labored briskly and carried more than his share of the load. But now again he stopped to look over at the outline of Building A, limned hard against hot blazing sky. And each time it was with a sense of heady exhilaration that he thought of his destiny -- his hard earned, dearly bought destiny. To be among that select group who would first set foot upon the surface of the Moon! He had no worries about not being allowed to do so. Once he showed himself -- with the ship far out in space -- they'd have to accept him. Not graciously of course, but they'd have to admire his courage and tenacity. They could not in all humanity, deny him a share of th victory. The day wore on and as quitting time approached, he became more tense -- more alert. Five minutes before the whistle, he faded back into the building and hurried to the lavatory. He went into the booth furthest from the entrance and locked the door. Now there was nothing to do but wait. Another of the calculated risks. The whistle blew. Almost immediately, the sound of footsteps broke the silence and the lavatory was filled with hurrying men. Their stay in the room was short, however, as Joe had known it would be. Men leaving for home do not dawA die on the premises. The lavatory was empty again. A period of silence while Joe raised his feet from the floor and braced them on the toilet seat. The entrance door opened. A guard making the departure checkup. Joe held his breath. If the guard came down the line and tried the door, he was finished. But Joe had banked upon human nature. The guard stopped. For a long .moment there was no sound and joe knew the man was bending over to run his eves down the line of toilets close to the floor. In this manner he could see the floor of every booth. The guard straightened, turned, walked out. The door closed. Silence. Joe's heart swelled with gratitude. He grinned, looking forward with joy to the long night ahead. He found a spot over behind the barrels where the night watchman would have to climb over a lot of equipment in order to find him. He made himself comfortable, practically certain the guard would not do this. He stretched out on the hard floor and recorded the passing of the hours by the number of times the watchman went through. And he was surprised at how fast the time passed. Finally, checking his count carefully, he left his hiding place and tiptoed to the line of lockers. He took the oxygen equipment from the duffel bag after which he hid the bag and the clothing therein behind a wall flange in a far corner... Then he climbed into the barrel at the front end of the packing line. He checked the barrel with a small X and jockeyed the lid into place.  pened. He wondered if he'd missed on the time element. The men should certainly have come to work now. More than once he was fempted to push the barrel lid aside and checkthe situation. When footsteps sounded, close by, and the lid snapped firmly into place, he was glad he hadn't done so. Good old Nick! When he got back from the Moon, he'd see to it that Nick got credit for his courageous act. Soon the barrel began to move. Joe felt it rise into the air and settle with a thump. Then the motor of a truck roared and Joe knew where he was going. Straight toward Building A and the Moon rocket. There was more movement until finally the barrel was set down for what appeared to be the last time, joe put the nose-piece of the oxygen tube into place and visualized himself safe and snug in a storage room of the rocket. He closed his eyes and went peacefully to sleep. He slept a long time, to be awakened by a crushing -- a wrenching -- that all but drove his head down into his spine. The pain brought him sharply alert. He knew instant' ly what had happened. Blast-off. He braced himself against the sides of the barrel and gritted his teeth.  Soon it was better. Then no pressure at all. Only the fierce happiness on his heart. He'd set a course and won through! He was on the way to the Moon! Joe let plenty of time elapse. He knew it was well over an hour later when he unlimbered the torch to cut an escape-hole in the barrel. This, he knew, would be tricky. He could easily burn himself. The heat would be intense. But it wasn't too bad. The aluminum cut quickly and in a matter of minutes, he was standing beside his barrel. As he'd suspected, it was a storage hold. The pitch darkness did not bother him. He'd come prepared with a small pencil flash that threw an adequate beam. He found the door, opened it and went out into a long passageway... N OW HE'D covered the length and breadth of the ship. He'd found a lot of rooms -- all in pitchdarkness. No observation ports. And no living thing. He stood frozen in one of the rooms while the beam of his flash picked out a code stenciled n a steel plate over some piece of machinery. X#-#MY -- Experimental -- Explosion Rocket -- Moon. The flash dropped from Joe Spain's fingers. He stood in the pitch darkness while the jets vibrated through the rocket. But there was no fear in him. Only the great pain of futility. Only his tears, and his whispered words: \"They'll never know. Nobody won't ever know!\" jua was neauty -- sne wa. Fascination -- she was Death  Klia had a beautiful why not? She made it herse body .

And then he would kill her and go. This was Ms task, set for him by the director of the Phoenician Quarantine Commission.

They were capable resting a part of the brain at a time having two cortical areas for bodily function. He knew she won become bored by ni tivity; sooner or later she come w city slept. In what findher? Her pearance did not c ran standards. #owy, nearly a! ightly i natura.  control her circulatory and glandular systems in such a way that fatty deposits would appear where she desired them and disappear in other places so that she could change her features and her form at will, as he himself had done. Of one thing he was certain : Her paranoid pride would not permit her to assume a guise regarded as ugly by this world. Most certainly she would make herself strikingly beautiful. San Rorrek however had reduced his body-weight, padded his cheekbones to give himself a gaunt appearance, dyed his hair black and his skin a sallow shade. An irritant, rubbed into pinpricks on his face, resulted in mild acne that made him something less than handsome. He smeared his teeth with brown stain, wore shabby second-hand clothing, and a pair of plain-rimmed glasses. He was not here to attract attention ; he was here to kill. He looked like a peddler or a laborer out of a job. He was walking down a sidestreet at midnight when he caught the first faint aura of her presence. She was somewhere within a few blocks, and she was planting a suggestion in the mind of the Terran who would not recognize the source of the thoughts as stemming from outside his own consciousness.  Sweee-whew! Thai dame on the corner! Did she look at me? Think Til walk that way. This was it! San had not reached out to touch the Terran # s mind, for in doing so he would broadcast his own thought-aura and reveal his presence to Klia. He had merely listened to Kfia's planting of the thought in the Terran s mind, and he caught the general direction from whence it came. He began walking rapidly up the street, then cut through the blackness of an alley. Was she playing games, or had she chosen a Terran to be of some service to her? Perhaps she was bored, and only wanted a brief love-affair... paused to peer toward both intersections. There were a few people on the sidewalk, but no woman tail enough to be Klia. He jaywalked and darted down the next alleyway. If the Terran had responded immediately to her suggestion, they would perhaps be gone before he could reach them. But then he caught another brief flash of thought-not words, but an image. She was helping the Terran imagine what she might look like without clothing. San chuckled as he trotted ahead. Unknowingly, she had given him a clue as to her appearance. Through glandular control, she had apparently padded herself to a remarkable condition of mammalian grandiloquence. The effect was almost surrealistic; the way a male might design a female if he had any choice in the matter. \"You liked that, eh?\" snarlecl a quiet voice from the darkness of a doorway. He stopped abruptly  in mid, alley, caught in a puddle of moonlight. She had tricked him. There had been no Ter ran. The phoney suggestion had been a trap. He glanced quickly around. \"Don't move,\" she snapped. \"I've got a native gun on. you -- a projectile weapon, in case you aren't familiar with their artifacts.\" Fie stood in stony silence, staring at the doorway until he made out her faint shadow. There was a tiny venom-gun strapped to his wrist, but its action would not be immediate, and if he used it, she would have ample time to kill him before she died. If it came to that he would use it, but now he hesitated, trying to piece together her immediate intentions. He shrugged and grinned. \"Okay. So I lost. Shoot and get it over with.\" \"Not here. They'd run an autopsy on you, pastoral. They'd figure you weren't quite Terran.\" \"Fm no pastoral. Pm an inventive.\" \"It's all the same to me, Rorrek. You're a lousy Thirder, Now move! Stay in the moonlight and walk slow. Stop when you come to the street. HI be right behind you.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Shut up! And don't start making suggestions at a policeman, or I'll kill you.\" Rorrek started walking. He felt her thoughts scanning lightly through various regions of consciousness-patterns until she found a taxi-driver. Then: I gotta hunch there's a customer on the next street . Think Til turn right. The taxi was approaching the alley entrance as they emerged. \"Flag it,\" she ordered. Rorrek obeyed grim-lipped. \"You get in first, darling,\" she said in a pleasant tone. \"I like to sit on the right\" \"That's just because I'm right handed, dear,\" he purred acidly. \"Where to, sir?\" Out of the city , the girl ordered Rorrek wordlessly. Tell him . \"Ask her. She's boss.\" The gun jabbed him ruthlessly in the ribs. The driver grinned. \"Where to, lady?\" She hesitated. \"A long trip?\" \"I low long?\" \"Oh, thirty, forty miles. North.\" \"It'll cost you.\" \"That's all right. Will twenty dollars do it?\" \"Maybe. Watch the meter and double it. You'll have to pay both ways.\" \"Let's go.\" Rorrek glanced at her sourly as they moved through the traffic. She had been exaggerating only slightly with the mental image used to trap him. The platinum blonde hair, the gray eyes, the aristocratic features, the full, slightly cynical mouth -- she conformed perfectly to the beauty standards of this world. The black dress revealed things that would have won her first place in any of the inane native female contests. \"You've done well by yourself, I see,\" he said, eyeing the expensive clothing and jewelry. What tele path couldn't? And stop talking aloud . He watched her for a moment. The gun was in her handbag. So was her hand. And she was keeping a sharp eye on him. Rorrek frowned No opening yet. Where are we going? Someplace where you can dig a hole without being seen.  Rorrek stared ahead at the traffic for a moment. He didn't need to ask her what the hole was for. ing an intersection and the light was just changing from green to red. Having heard the girl summon the taxi, Rorrek knew the man's consciousness pattern. He adjusted to it quickly and planted a rapid suggestion: Damn the light ! I can make it! The girl cursed and lifted the handbag. The light was already red. A car shot out from the other street. The brakes screamed. A policewhistle shrilled angrily. \"Shoot,\" Rorrek dared, smirking at Klia. The handbag hesitated. \"Make a wrong move and I'll have to.\" The driver was too busy with his own troubles to hear them. The cop came stalking across the pavement. \"You like to live dangerously, huh?\" he said in a bored voice. The cabby began a plaintive explanation. \"Come on, dear,\" said Klia. \"We'll catch another cab \" \"I like this one,\"  Get out , or Fll kilt you and the cop too. Pay the driver. Rorrek handed the driver a dollar. They crossed to the sidewalk and the girl looked shaken. This was a busier street and there were  m more pedestrians. He grinned at her again. \"May I buy you a drink before you finish me off?\" Surprisingly, she replied, \"Fll let you live that long, pastoral. It's interesting to watch you try to wiggle out of it.\" He knew she meant it. She could have hypnotized the cop and the driver, shot him in the cab, and strolled calmly away as one of a dozen multiple mental images. She could still do it, but evidently the idea of making him dig his own grave appealed to her icy sense of humor. They entered a small bar and she directed him toward a secluded booth. \"I'm surprised you haven't used your wrist weapon yet,\" she said as they sipped a martini. \"Apparently you pastorals have no capability for self-sacrifice.\" His face showed no surprise, but he rested his arm across the table. He smirked. \"I was waiting for a better opportunity, but since you put it that way let's get it over with.\" His other hand darted toward the lethal wrist. \"One moment,\" she said. He paused. \"Do you have an extra projectile?\" He frowned, then nodded. She smiled again, and laid a braceleted white arm across the table. \"I'll skve you the trouble of firing. Prick me with it.\" His throat started with surprise. \"You're not immune,\" he hissed. \"To Ayoyo venom? Try me.\" Rorrek gained new admiration for her. The process of immunization was an excruciatingly painful treatment covering three years and mean but this for a and she Correct, pastoral us from sent us to an ironhe pro #k i \"Fm an inventive.\" \"An artificial category. An inventive is a maladjusted pastoral who wishes he were I a Klidd.\" Her use of the ancient feudal name for her race startled him. His people had almost forgotten it. Once on Nu Phoenicis IV there had been the Klidds, or barons, the Algum or serfs, and the Taknon, or artisans. The feudal system had lasted more than five thousand years, and because of natural selection operating within the occupational groups, the three classes had become genetically distinct. After the rise of a technology, the Klidds were overthrown and exiled to the ironless fourth planet where they formed their own ruthless social order under a strict space quarantine, enforced by the Taknon spaceforce which Rorrek served. ;uing heredity with he said. \" ss your t s go, .e signals.

Just stand there and keep your hands in sight.\" Rorrek kept his hands in sight. He stared at the cop, suggesting nausea, suggesting a fluttering of the heart, suggesting asphyxiation. The cop began to gasp and reel. Rorrek increased the mental dosage. The cop choked and fainted. As Rorrek walked calmly out into the night, he heard voices behind him telling that the girl was dead. He felt sick himself now. There was something compelling about Klia, something that attracted. He felt a little like a child,  drawn toward a cruel mother -- or Terra possessed the only human life in the galaxy. So he was stuck here for life unless a Taknon ship came to pick him up, and there had been no guarantee of that from the Commission. Secret landings on nonspacegoing planets were forbidden except in several specifically defined emergencies. Rescuing a second-class agent was not one of them. , He was faced with a life of ease but of loneliness. A telepath would have no difficulty acquiring tremendous wealth here, but a telepath would have no company -- unless he could find a few natives a husband, lured to a wantonly selfish and unfaithful mistress. He knew she had to be killed, yet now that it was done, he felt rotten inside. At last he found a doctor and had his flesh-wound dressed. Fie stared at the doctor peculiarly and the medic seemed to forget it had been a bullet wound. Rorrek went 'i whose neural associative circuits were so ordered as to make telepathy latently possible. Occasionally he had encountered a Terran whose thought-aura was vaguely perceptible. Perhaps, through long and patient hypnotic conditioning, their latent abilities could be brought forth. If the genetic hodgepodge could be straightened out, Terran had high possibilities. Their\" basic genetic emotion-patterns were not as sharply divided into groups a those of Nu Phoenicis, but the patterns were present, and the conflict among them was present. Rather than calling them Pastorals, Inventives, and Imperials, as in the Phoenician case, he decided perhaps that the basic Terran-pattems could best be described by the goals they were inclined to favor. The \"Security-Seekers\", the \"Knowledge-Seekers\", and the \"GlorySeekers\" perhaps. Phoenician code forbade any tampering with non-threat cultural forms, but who was there to enforce it? And in a sense, this was his planet now. Marooned here, he could participate in a subtle way, and help a few local inventives find new directions. Maybe he owed who would certainly have steered them spaceward, although the end result would have been disastrous for them, had her plan worked. Francisco he spent replenishing his funds through poker games, wrestling matches, and various forms of betting in which thoughtprojective powers were a distinct advantage. Then he rented a house in the suburbs, ordered half a ton of various electronic parts, and began building several computer units while he concentrated on revising his physical appearance to a more pleasing form. As the weeks passed, he put on weight, removed the fatty tissue from his cheekbones, thickened his cheeks enough to remove the gauntness, and restored his complexion to a healthier hue. When he was finished, he had the appearance of a gregarious young businessman, cleanly attractive but not offensively handsome. He finished the computer shortly after he finished himself. It was not a large unit as computers went. It was built into a chassis the size of an eight-foot refrigerator. A Terran might say it was constructed to handle problems in that rarefied strata of mathematics known as the Von Neumann theory of games. But the twenty-four instruments on its face were calibrated in \"points per share\". Rorrek spent a month in libraries, photographing stock-market reports covering a thirty-year period. These he laboriously studied, plotting the rise and fall of each stock on graphs, writing empirical equations to describe each graph, and feeding the equations to the computer's memory tanks. Fed also into the tanks, were thirty-year record-equations describing taxrates, population growth, national income, government expenditures, world armaments, exports, imports, and average individual incomes. The computer, required to assume that all the variables were dependent upon one another, evolved an implicit function in some thirtyseven variable quantities. He then fed it the \"present conditions\" and required it to extrapolate the values forward over a period of two months. Eleven stocks appeared due for sharp rises within the period. San Rorrek invested ten thousand dollars. At the end of two months, the stocks had risen fifteen thousand. He corrected the small errors in the computer's estimates by supplying new data, then extrapolated again, selling and reinvesting in accordance with the new predictions. There was danger, of course, that a completely unpredictable series of events might occur to cause unfavorable market fluctuations. Therefore he very carefully watched world conditions, political developments, and technical advancements. Klia's articles were still appearing in magazines and technical journals, but that was not surprising, considering the usual lag between the acceptance of an essay and its publication. And the pieces were having subtle repercussions in the news, attracting no attention in themselves, but spurring certain scientists to think along new lines. Klia had suggested a method for testing basic mental formative patterns in infancy; and now a western university's psychology department was setting up a research lab \"for studying the basic affective reaction patterns of infants at birth\". Klia, under another pen-name, had suggested an extension of relativistic mechanics to cover hypothetical N-dimensional universes. The newspapers announced now that the famous mathematician, Larwich, was beginning work on the creation of a mathematical physics with no basic assumptions other than those of elementary arithmetic. \"Man's only insight into reality,\" said Larwich, \"derives  from his ability to count on his fingers. All else is purely experiential approximation.\" Rorrek grinned. Klia had been \" trying to steer Terran inventors straight toward a fivespace interstellar drive, while the government  research in the hope of reaching the moon. She was trying to get the mathematicians to see the velocity of light as a constant only at one specific universe-level of five-space, and as a different constant at other levels. And she had managed to steer Larwich in the right direction. Only one thing was lacking: an experiential tie between observable reality and the theory Larwich would certainly develop. Without' it, the theory would remain merely abtruse mathematical speculation of an invariantive nature. Rorrek's fingers itched at the typewriter, longing to supply the missing suggestion. A guilt-reaction, he told himself, probably associated with Klia's death. Nevertheless he wrote an essay entitled \"Origin of Interstellar Hydrogen\", and sent it to a university press periodical. The article suggested that the spontaneous appearance of matter in the fourspace cosmos could be explained in terms of a five-space continuum with a circulation of matter along the fifth component. The essay was rejected with a brief note from the editor: \"Sorry, but we just last week purchased an essay dealing with the mechanics of this 'continuous creation # notion. Your style is good. Try us again, .soon. Editor. # ' Rorrek snorted and chucked the essay in the wastebasket. Some local yokel had probably beat him to the draw with some weirdly empirical notion that left out the tie with five-space. The rejection irritated him. He decided to give it up for a while, and concentrate on making himself Dr. Larwich was in San Francisco for the summer. After some debate about the desirability of direct intervention, he found the professor's address -- a modest cottage overlooking the bay with a short stretch of narrow beach before it. half a mile away. Three days later he wandered I past the professor's cottage, having spied three brown todies sunbathing on the beach before it. As he drew nearer, he studied them curiously. An elderly couple and a girl in her late twenties, possibly Larwich's daughter. She was watching him casually -- a large, dark girl with hazel eyes and firm breasts. Rorrek approached 'the group. \"Am I still on a public beach?\" he asked, \"Or am I a trespasser?\" The elderly couple glanced up questioningly. The girl smiled. \"Trespassers are welcome. Help yourself.\" She had a nice musical voice. \"I've got the next cottage down the line,\" he said. \"Bui I scarcely realized I had neighbors.\" \"It is lonely out here. Won't you sit with us awhile? You look tired.\" Rorrek grinned and patted a slight bulge in his mid-section. \"Trying to work off my bay window.\" He strolled toward them, scraping his feet in the sand. The old man looked down at his own sagging belly, then glowered at the stranger. \"Young man, you have just committed a grievous faux pas, # ' he grunted. \"I'm Edith Larwich,\" said tke girl. \"This is my father. Frank Larwich... and my mother, Louise.\" He nodded and sat down. \"I'm Sam Rory.\" He hesitated, looking at the professor and gathering a frown. \"Larwich -- Frank Larwich -- I've heard of you, I think. Is it Doctor Larwich -- of the new-look in invariantive viewpoints?\" The old man looked surprised. He lifted his eyebrows first at his wife, then his daughter. He extended his hand to Rorrek and looked a beam of amusement down his slender nose. \"Young man, you have just absolved yourself of that faux pas. What school are you with?\" \"No school.\" \"What research lab, then?\" \"No lab, I'm a gambler.\" \"Bah! Stop joking. Laymen don't talk about invariance, or remember the names of old codgers like me.\" i He shrugged, \"I apologize for being a layman, sir, but I like mathematics. I've read a few of your pieces in the digest.\" Larwich glanced at his wife and daughter again. They were looking curiously at Rorrek. \"My fame comes as a distinct shock to me,\" the old man said tea n#  V mm a it?  n managed to rom her body, beauty were to appeal to him, o you expect to publish theory.

Any man would could work that theory out in a few months was certainly the mental equal of the best minds of his own race. It startled him. Here seemed proof enough that T erran-humanity was going places, given a little intelligent biosocial reform. \"That's remarkable,\" he murmured,. \"I thought it would be at least two years,\" \"So did I. But Edith here helped me tremendously with certain down-to-earth suggestions.

When Harwich was through, physicists could build an experimental five-space generator on the basis of his theory. When the physicists were through making data-tables, engineers would be able to construct a working model interstellar drive, provided someone would make the investment.

Rorrek watched her plunging gracefully in the surf, and he wondered at his vague uneasiness.  \"What do you really do, Sam?\" Larwich asked. \"Investor. I hit it lucky on the market. Gambler -- same thing \" . Larwich chuckled. \"You evidently read technical publications as a hobby, then. Or are you working on a mathematical way to beat the stock market?\" Rorrek smiled enigmatically, and got to his feet. \"You might try the Von Neumann theory of games,\" he offered, then smiled sheepishly. \"If you'll excuse me, I think I'll join  your daughter for a swim.\" feeble breakers when he trotted through the shallow water, but she rolled on her back to wave ' and watch him. A very beautiful, intelligent girl, he thought calculating! y. If he were to remain marooned on Terra, it would be interesting to see if normal procreation could result from marriage with a native. He felt an urge to touch the girl's mind, then decided against it for the present. Some Terr an s seemed sensitively receptive, and they became startled by undue power. She lay treading water until he swam up beside her, then she smiled but her eyes were thoughtful. \"Water's nice!\" he grunted. \"Is it?\" He frowned. \"Why the challen ing tone ?\" Who are you, anyway?\" Just who I said I was.

Was she angling? \"Just fine \" he said. \"Why don't you come down?\" She lifted her wet head from the tide and nodded soberly. \"I will. Very soon.\" Again he felt the vague uneasiness. Rorrek spent the afternoon on his porch, watching the bay. Tomorrow he meant to go back to the suburbs, return to the task of making hirnself the wealthiest man in the country as quickly as possible, then start endowing universities with research grants like a fat old capitalist with a guilty conscience. Twilight came, and he felt the loneliness of an alien longing for home. He visualized the warm, rollwith pastoral Algun villages, and the great walled city-states of the Taknon, covering hundreds of square miles and set in the midst of the Algun landscape. They worked in harmony, the two races -- each maintaining its own government, each keeping itself socially and biologically separated, yet each realizing that one could not exist and prosper without the other. It was a class society that worked, worked because the classes were divided according to the goals they sought, not according to any artificial framework. Of course, Man's goals were chosen in the light of his emotions and aptitudes, and at least among the Phoenicians, emotion and aptitude patterns were founded on genetic bed-rock. It was only rarely that Taknon aptitudes were bom in an Algun village, and equally rare when a pastorally inclined child appeared in the Taknon cities. Loneliness weighed heavily on him. With some misgivings he closed his eyes, and searched through the transor regions for the Larwich girl's pattern of consciousness. When he passed through it, he started up with a low gasp -- and lost the pattern. There had been a knife-edge sharpness about it -- a clarity of focus that suggested resonant neural circuits as in the trained telepath. He groped for it again. But when he found it, the sharpness was gone -- if it had really been there. The transor was strong but blurred, unreadable. He decided his first impression had been illusion. I wonder what that young man is doing ? he suggested. He did invite me to his beach. Maybe if I walked down that way . He paused a moment, trying to catch the blurred images that swam in leisure through her consciousness. But they were too muddled. He withdrew from her and waited. Half-a-mile might be too far for the untrained mind to catch the faint suggestion, and even though she would mistake the thoughts for her own, she might offer herself some counter-excuse for not coming. the failing gray of twilight. After a few minutes, the screen door opened, and someone stood on the porch. Then she trotted down the steps to the beach and came walking his way, but looking toward the sea. As she drew nearer; he saw that she was wearing white shorts and a pale blue blouse with the tail knotted about her waist. The wind whipped the blouse against her breasts and ruffled her short dark hair like a nest of feathers. He watched her come toward him with narrow speculative eyes, and he wondered again: Was a procreative union possible here? She looked toward him and waved, breaking his reverie, then on apparently sudden impulse turned and plodded through the sand toward his porch. \"Am I trespassing? Or did you invite me to your beach?\" \"Come on up,\" he called. \"I was just wishing you'd drop by.\" She hooked her foot on the step and cocked her head at him. \"Why?\" It startled him. \"The answer to that,\" he chuckled, \"might be  found in textbooks of psychology and biology, particularly the latter. Come up and sit down.\" \"Not if you're going to be biological #  \"Only in t respectively so. I have insufficient data on the subject to feel safe in rash experiments.\" She laughed aid came up to take a chair, propping her long, trim legs on the rail. \"The subject is a carnivore who might chew off an ear. #  \"Mrnmp! How about a nice thick steak with onions and french fries and a gallon of beer?\" \"The bloated subject would fall asleep in her cage\" \"Exactly. # She watched him with cool amusement in the dusk. \"I think we find each other attractive.\" \"Tm glad it's mutual. I have plans for you. #  She dropped her legs, rested her elbows on her knees, and swung half around to grin peculiarly, head cocked up at him. \"Okay, Sam. Finish the funny story.' He leaned toward her and tried to steal as softly as possible into her consciousness pattern, but he kept his voice light and casual. \"The plan is simple biology, but it involves many unknowns as yet For instance -- \" He pulled her face toward him slowly, and moulded her mouth with his. Quietly they slipped to their feet, locked tightly together, laughing quietly with soft fire where their faces touched. He brought his mind slowly into full resonance with her pattern, demanding her to respond. The response was white flame, but not of the body. His mind reeled for an instant before he understood. Full focus ! Too bright! And something hard against Ms ribs. You should have been born a Klidd! He backed away, staring at her, and the glint of metal in her hand. I wasn't certain , she went on until you threw that full resonance at me. \"Klia!\" \"Yes.\" She found a cigaret with her left hand and lit it while she held the gun on him with her right. He could see her face in the match-flare, and it appeared tight and drawn. \"Your lipstick is smeared,\" he offered. \"Thanks. It was a pleasure. Fm really sorry I have to kill you \" \"Like you killed Larwich's blind daughter and took her place?\" Klia snorted. \"Shes not dead. She's still blind, and she's an amnesiac in a Pennsylvania psychopathic ward.\" \"Hypnotically induced amnesia, undoubtedly. # \"Right. I had to get her personality patterns, and leave her a blank\" \"I thought I left you dead on the floor.\" She sighed impatiently. \"Would a Terran know when a Phoenician was dead?\" Rorrek saw his blunder and' gritted his teeth. He'd been a fool to believe. Naturally, every time someone touched her wrist to test her pulse, she had simply stopped her heartbeat until the fellow let go, or perhaps shut off the circulation in the arm. \"Well, you've got Larwich well on the road to the theory of a space drive, I see.\" She nodded, started to reply, paused, then: \"You didn't suspect me because you thought I was dead. Then why did you come prowling around Larwich?\" \"To do what you've already done.\" \"You're lying.\" \"See for yourself,\" He began sliding into resonance with her, but she bached away warily and blocked him out. \"You can break it whenever you want to,\" he said. She risked it, and their transors found sharp focus again. He reeled off the contents of his associative circuits relating to Larwich and his theory, reeled them off too rapidly for them to be inventions of the moment. Then he switched to memories concerning his thoughts of her. \"Why did you do that?\" she muttered when he was through. Her voice was shaky, and the gun seemed to be sagging in her hand. He shrugged. \"We're a long way from Nu Phoenicis. I expect to be here for good.\" \"You will be,\" she said ominously, straightening. \"Start marching down to the water.\" \"Why?\" \"The tide's going out. You'll go with it \" \"Suppose I suggest we work together,\" She laughed scornfully. \"Move, quickly, Taknon!\" He walked slowly down the steps and into the faint moonlight. He moved ahead with a calm leisurely tread. Behind him the girl laughed. \"You're part Klidd, Rorrek. A hybrid -- or a throwback.\" He failed to ask her why. \"I could feel affection for a Taknon, but I couldn't love one. Fve watched you. You're part Klidd. I can feel it.\" He wondered why his throat constricted. He said nothing. \"I love you, Rorrek. Damn your hide.\" But she loved her planet more. \"What are you going to do about Larwich now?\" he asked coldly. \"Are you going to switch to someone else, or are you going to keep on brazening it out?\" \"Switch. I'm through with him. He's on the right course,\" Rorrek started wading into shallow water. \"Go on out past the breakers,\" she called. \"I don't want you to wash back in.\" \"Glad to oblige,\" he grunted, but he paused to look back. She had kicked off her sandals and was wading after him. She stopped, gun glinting in the moonlight. \"Well?\" \"'One thing.\" He scanned for her mind, but she blocked, refusing him resonance. He bludgeoned through until he made a strong but fuzzy contact. He held the contact, but turned away and began wading through the gentle rush of breakers while he wandered through his associative circuits concerning Stop it, Rorrek! I Then the resonance was complete., and he chuckled, because she was going to feel it when she shot him. Beyond the breakers, he turned again to fac her. She was reeling dizzily, holding the gun at arm's length, with her left hand pressed tight to her face. shots when they came. Two went wide, but the third seared his chest, and he went down, fighting for air. hearing a choking scream from Kiia. He gasped once and went under, swimming weakly for deeper water. Another bullet streaked phosphorescence through the blackness about him. He drove still deeper, clinging precariously to consciousness. Another slug streaked under him ard he veered upward. Seven cartridges in the gun, five gone. If he could only live a little longer. Then he had to rise for air. He spun around and came up slowly, facing shore. She was walking dejectedly back across the beach toward his cottage. He waited for her to look back. He dog-paddled with the waves, but the tide seemed to be sweeping him out. \"PraTaW Bladen, Klia! # he choked in their native tongue. \"For the love of Man!\" She heard him. She turned slowly, watched him coldly for a moment, pistol lifted high. \" PraTalf Kliddn, TaknonV # came her icy paraphrase. The gun barked, and barked again. Seven! But this time it was his abdomen, and he heard himself screaming as he fought toward shore. He could only partially control the flow of blood to the wounds. When tissue cried for blood, the unconscious reflex let it go. It was like holding one's breath, and occasionally he had to bleed. She was standing there watching him, white in the moonlight, locked in a kind of trance. Co, he thought at her savagely. When I get there , Vll kill you -- for those last two shots. She looked at the gun in her hand. She let it drop, stared down at it, wiped the hand distastefully on her shorts. She backed away a step, stumbled in the sand, and sat down, rolling her head on her knees. He groped for her mind, and she erected no block. She hoped he would die before he got to shore, but she wasn't going to move. Fate, about to be satisfied -- it gave him angry strength. A breaker washed over him from behind, and he rode with it briefly. When it passed him by and dropped him, he stood chest-deep, wading shoreward. He peered at her dazedly, hands clenching and unclenching in anticipation. He let her feel the strength of his hate, but her thoughts were wandering -- her home, her people. But she saw them differently somehow, as if she were no longer capable of being guided by their values. Her affective framework had collapsed. She sat in a bewildered daze. He staggered from the water and fell to his knees on the sand. He crawled toward her with savage deliberation in the moonlight going to  a i v t him brittle shattered. She screamed and pawed at her face. He hit her again and again, rblling across the sand, battering her face until his fists were driving into wet pulp. \"My eyes! My eyes!\" Weakly he crouched over her, staring. She had been wearing contact lenses. The green irises had been stained on the glass to cover her gray ones.

They didn't come' out of their holes or hovels or down from the trees. But why ?\" \"Well, let's forget it. Let's go back to camp. We can try again tomor -- look! Look, there's something!\" Judd followed her pointing finger with his eyes. Half-hidden by the creepers and vines clinging to an old ' tree-stump, something was watching them. It wasn't very big and it seemed in no hurry to get away. \"What is it?\" Lindy wanted to know. \"Don't know. Never saw anything like it before. Venus is still an unknown frontier; the books only name a couple dozen of the biggest animals. But hell, Lindy, that's not game. I don't think it weighs five pounds.\" \"It's cute, and it has a lovely skin.\" Judd couldn't argue with that. Squatting on its haunches, the creature was about twenty inches tall. It had a pointed snout and two thin, long ears. Its eyes were very big and very round and quite black. They looked something like the eyes of an Earth! an tarsier, hut the tarsier were bloody little beasts. The skin was short and stiff and was a ft kind of silvery white. Under the sheen, however, it seemed to glow. A diamond is colorless, Judd thought, but \"when you see it under light a whole rainbow of colors sparkle deep within it. This creature's skin was like that, Judd decided. \"If we could get enough of them,\" Lindy was saving, \"Fd have the most unusual coat! Do you think we could find enough, Judd?\" \"I doubt it. Never saw anything like it before, never heard of anything like it. You'd need fifty of 'em, anyway. Let's forget about it -- too small to shoot, anyway.\" \"No, Judd. I want it.\" \"Well, I'm not going to stalk a five-pound -- hey, wait a minute! I taught you how to use this rifle, so why don't you bag it?\" Lindy grinned. \"That's a fine idea. I was a little scared of some of those big lizards and cats and everything, but now I'm going to take you up on it. Here, give me your gun.\" Judd removed the leather thong from his shoulder and handed the weapon to her. She looked at it a little uncertainly, then took the clip of shells which Judd offered and slammed it into the chamber. The little creature sat unmoving. \"Isn't it peculiar that it doesn't run away, Judd?\" \"Sure is. Nothing formidable about that animal, so unless it has a hidden poison somewhere, just about anything in this swamp could do it in. To survive it would have to be fast as hell and it would have to keep running all the time. Beats me, Lindy \" \"Well, Tm going to get myself one pelt toward that coat, anyway. Watch, Judd: is this the way?\" She lifted the rifle to her shoulder and squinted down the sights toward the shining creature. \"Yeah, that's the way. Only relax. Relax. Shoulder's so tense you're liable to dislocate it with the kick. There -- that's better.\" Now Lindy's finger was wrapped around the trigger and she remembered Judd had told her to squeeze it, not to pull it. If you pulled the trigger you jerked the rifle and spoiled your aim. You had to squeeze it slowly... The animal seemed politely interested. Suddenly, a delicious languor stole over Lindy. It possessed her all at once and she had no idea where it came from. Her legs had been stiff and tired from the allmorning trek through the swamp, but now they felt fine. Her whole body was suffused in a warm, satisfied glow of well-being. And laziness. It was an utterly new sensation and she could even feel it tingling even at the roots of her hair. She sighed and lowered the rifle. \"I don't want to shoot it,\" she said. \"You just told me you did.\" \"I know, but I changed my mind. What's the matter, can't I change my mind?\" \"Of course you can change your mind. But I thought you wanted a coat of those things.\" \"Yes, I suppose I do. But I don't want to shoot it, that's all,\" Judd snorted. \"I think you have a streak of softness someplace in that pretty head of yours!\" \"Maybe. I don't know. But I'd still like the pelt. Funny, isn't it?\" \"Okay, okay! But don't ask to use the gun again.\" Judd snatched it from her hands. \"If you don't want to shoot it, then I will we can make you a pair of or something from the pelt.\" And Judd pointed his ancient rifles at the little animal preparing to snap off a quick shot. It would be a cinch at this distance. Even Lindy wouldn't have missed, if she hadn't changed her mind. Judd yawned. He'd failed to realize he was so tired. Not an aching kind of tiredness, but the kind that makes you feel good all over. He yawned again and lowered the rifle. \"Changed my mind,\" he said. \"I don't want to shoot it, either. What say we head back for camp?\" Lindy gripped his hand impulsively. \"All right, Judd -- but I had a brainstorm! I want it for a pet!\" \"A pet?\" \"Yes. I think it would be the cutest thing. Everyone would look and wonder and I'll adore it!\" \"We don't know anythin! it. Maybe Earth would be too cold, or too dry, or maybe we don't have anything it can eat. There are liable to be a hundred different strains of bacteria that can kill it.\" \"I said I want it for a pet. See? Look at it! We can call it tc Eyes\" Black Eyes -- \" Judd groaned. Yes, Black Eyes. If you don't do this one thing for me, Judd -- \" , ut I'm not to do any tiling. You want it, you take it.\" Lindy frowned, looked at him crossly, then sloshed across the swamp toward Black Eyes. The creature waited on its stump until she came quite close, and then, with a playful little bound, it hopped onto her shoulder, still squatting on its haunches. Lindy squealed excitedly and began to stroke its silvery fur. to Earth, Judd and Lindy and Black Eyes. The hunting trip had been a success -- Judd's trophies were on their way home on a slow' freighter, and he'd have some hne heads and skins for his study-room. Even Black Eyes had been no trouble at all. It ate scraps from their table, forever sitting on its haunches and staring at them with its big black eyes. Judd thought it would make one helluva lousy pet, but he didn't tell Lindy. Trouble was, it never did anything. It merely sat still, or occasionally it would bounce down to the floor and mince along on its hind-legs for a scrap of food. It never uttered a sound. It did not frolic and it did not gambol. Most of the time it could have been carved from stone. But Lindy was happy and Judd said nothing. They had a little trouble with the customs officials. This because nothing unknown could be brought to Earth without a thorough examination. At the customs office, a bespectacled official stared at Black Eyes, scratching his head. \"Never seen one like that before' \"Neither have I,\" Judd admitted. \"Well, I'll look in the book.\" The man did, but there are no thorough tomes on Venusian fauna. \"Not here.\" \"I could have told you.\" \"Well, we'll have to quarantine it and study it. That means .you and your wife go into quarantine, too. It could have something that's catching.\" \"Absurd!\" Lindy cried. \"Sorry, lady. I only work here.\" \"You and your bright ideas,\" Judd told his wife acidly. \"We may be quarantined a month until they satisfy themselves about Black Eyes.\" The customs official shrugged Ms bony shoulders; and Judd removed a twenty credit note from his pocket and handed it to the man. \"Will this change your mind?\" \"I should say not! You can't bribe me, Mr. Whitney! You can't -- \" The man yawned, stretched languidly, smiled. \"No sir, you can keep your money, Mr. Whitney. Guess we don't have to examine your pet after all. Mighty cute little feller. Well, have fun with it. Come on, move along now.\" And, as they were departing with Black Eyes, still not believing their ears: \"Darn this weather! Makes a man so lazy... It was after the affair at the customs office, that Black Eyes uttered its first sound. City life hasn't changed much in the last fifty years. Jet-cars still streak around the circumferential highways, their whistles blaring. Factories still belch smoke and steam, although the new s atomic power plants have lessened that to a certain extent. Crowds still throng the streets, noisy, hurrying, ill-mannered. Ids one of those things that can't be helped, A city has to live, and it has to make noise. But it seemed to frighten Lindy's new pet. It stared through the jetcar window on the way from the spaceport to the Whitney's suburban home, its black eyes welling with tears. \"Look!\" Judd exclaimed. \"Black Eyes can cry!\" \"A crying pet, Judd. I knew there would be something unusual about Black Eyes, I just knew it!\" The tears in the big black eyes overflowed and tumbled out, rolling down Black Eyes' silvery cheeks. And then Black Eyes whimpered. It was only a brief whimper, but both Judd and Lindy heard it, and even the driver turned around for a moment and stared at the animal. The driver stopped the jet. He yawned and rested his head comfortably on the cushioned seat. He went quietly to sleep. owned the Merrywinkle Shipping Service. That, in itself, was not unusual. But at precisely the moment that Black Eyes unleashed its mild whimper, Mr. Merrywinkle -- uptown and five miles away -- called an emergency conference of the board of directors and declared: \"Gentlemen, we have all been working too hard, and I, for one, am going to take a vacation. I don't know when I'll be back, but it  won't be before six months;\" \"But someone protested. \"There's the Parker deal and the Gilette contract and a dozen other things. You're needed!\" Mr. Merrywinkle shook his bald head. \"What's more, you're all taking vacations, with pay. Six months, each of you. We're closing down Merrywinkle Shipping for half a year. Give the competition a break, eh?\" \"But C.M.! We're about ready to squeeze out Chambers Parcel Co.! They'll get back on their feet in six months.\" \"Never mind. Notify all departments of the shut-down, effective immediately. Vacations for all.' # belt?\" the foreman asked mildly. He was not a mild man and he usually stormed and ranted at the slightest provocation. This was at Clewson Jctcraft, and you couldn't produce a single jet-plane without the assembly belt, naturally. A plump little man said, \"I did.\" \"But why?\" the foreman asked him, smiling blandly. \"I don't know. I just did.\" The foreman was still smiling. \"I don't blame you.\" Two days later, Clewson Jetcraft had to lay off all its help. They put ads in all the papers seeking new personnel but no one showed up. Clewson was forced to shut down. York pneumo-tube commuter's special pulled to a bone-jarring stop immediately outside the New York station. Some angry commuters pried open the conductor's cab, and found the man snoozing quite contentedly. They awakened him, but he refused to drive the train any further. All the commuters had to leave the pneumotrain and edge their way along three miles of catwalk to the station, No one was very happy about it,but the feeling of well-being which came over them all nipped any possible protest in the bud. when Judd and Lindy reached home but after that it was quiet. It just sat on its haunches near the window and stared out at the city. The quiet city. Nothing moved in the streets. Nothing stirred. People remained at home watching local video or the new space-video from Mars. At first it was a good joke, and the newspapers could have had a field day with it, had the newspapers remained in circulation. After four days, however, they suspended publication. On the fifth day, there was a shortage of food in the city, great stores of it spoiling in the warehouses. Heat and light failed after a week, and the fire department ignored all alarms a day later. But everything did not stop. School teachers still taught their classes; clerks still sold whatever goods were left on local shelves. Librarians were still at their desks. Conservatives said it was a liberal plot to undermine capital and demand higher wages; liberals said big business could afford the temporary layoff and wanted to squeeze out the small businessman and labor unions. Scientists pondered and city officials made speeches over video. \"Something,\" one of them observed, \"has hit our city. Work that requires anything above a modicum of sound has become impossible; in regards to such work people have become lazy. No one can offer any valid suggestions concerning the malady. It merely exists. However, if a stop is not put to it -- and soon -- our fair city will disintegrate. Something is making us lazy, and that laziness can spell doom, being a compulsive lack of desire to create any noise or disturbance. If anyone believes he has the solution, he  should contact the Department of Science at once. If you can't use the video-phone, come in person. But come! Every hour which passes adds to the city's woes.\" ' Nothing but scatter-brained ideas for a week, none of them worth consideration. Then the bespectacled custom's official who had bypassed quarantine for Black Eyes, got in touch with the authorities. He had always been a conscientious man -- except for that one lapse. Maybe the queer little beast had nothing to do with this crisis. But then again, the custom's official had never before -- or since -- had... that strange feeling of lassitude. Could there be some connection? A staff of experts on extra-terrestrial fauna was dispatched to the Whitney residence, although, indeed, the chairman of the Department of Science secretly considered the whole idea ridiculous. The staff of experts introduced themselves. Then, ignoring the protests of Lindy, went to work on Black Eyes. At first Judd thought the animal would object, but apparently it did not. While conditions all about' them in the city worsened, the experts spent three days studying Black Eyes. They found nothing out of the ordinary. Black Eyes merely stared back at them, and but for an accident, they would have departed without a lead. On the third day, a huge mongrel dog which belonged to the Whitney's next-door neighbors somehow slipped its leash. It was a fierce and ugly animal, and it was known to attack anything smaller than itself. It jumped the fence and landed in Judd Whitney's yard. A few loping bounds took it through an open window, ground level. Inside, it spied Black Eyes and made for the creature at once, howling furiously. Black Eyes didn't budge. And the mongrel changed its mind! The slavering tongue withdrew inside the chops, the howling stopped. The mongrel lay down on the floor and whined. Presently it lost all interest, got to its feet, and left as it had come. Other animals were brought to the Whitney home. Cats. Dogs. A lion from the city zoo, starved for two days and brought in a special mobile cage by its keeper. Black Eyes was thrust into the cage and the lion gave forth with a hideous yowling. Soon it stopped, rolled over, and slept. their reports, returned with them to the Whitney house. The leader, whose name was Jamison, said: \"As closely as we can tell, Black Eyes is the culprit.\" \"What?\" Lindy demanded. \"Yes, Mrs. Whitney. Your pet, Black Eyes.\" \"Oh, I don't believe it!\" But Judd said, \"Go ahead, Dr. Jamison. I'm listening.\" \"Well, how does an animal -- any animal -- protect itself?\" \"Why, in any number of ways. If it has claws or a strong jaw and long teeth, it can fight. If it is fleet of foot, it can run. If it is big and has a tough hide, most other animals can't hurt it anyway. Ummmm, doesn't that about cover it?\" \"You left out protective coloration, defensive odors, and things like that. Actually, those are most important from our point of view, for Black Eyes' ability is a furtherramification of that sort of thing. Your pet is not fast. It isn't strong. It can't change color and it has no offensive odor to chase off predatory enemies. It has no armor. In short, can you think of a more helpless creature to put down in those Venusian swamps?\" After Judd had shaken his head, Dr. Jamison continued: \"Very well, Black Eyes should not be able to survive on Venus -- and I yet, obviously the creature did. We can assume there are more of the breed, too. Anyway, Black Eyes survives. And I'll tell you why. \"Black Eyes has a very uncommon ability to sense danger when it approaches. And sensing danger,  I Black Eyes can thwart it. Your creature sends out certain emanations -- I won't pretend to know what they are -- which stamp aggression out of any predatorycreatures. Neither of you could fire upon it -- right?\" \"Urnm-mm, that's true Judd said. Lindy nodded. \"Well, that's one half of it. There's so much about life we don't understand. Black Eyes uses energy of an unknown intensity, and the result maintains Black Eyes' life. Nov, although that is the case, your animal did not live a comfortable life in the Venusian swamp. Because no animal would attack it, it could not be harmed. Still, from what you tell me about that swamp... i '\"Anyhow. Black Eyes was glad to come away with you, and everything went well until you landed in New York. The noises, the clattering, the continual bustle of a great city -- all this frightened the creature. It was being attacked -- or, at least that's what it must have figured. Result: it struck back the only way it knew how. Have you ever heard about sub-sonic soundwaves, Mr. Whitney, waves of sound so low that our ears cannot pick them up -- waves of sound which can nevertheless stir our emotions? Such things exist, and, as a working hypothesis, I would say Black Eyes' strange powers rest along those lines. The whole city is idle because Black Eyes is afraid!\" In his exploration of Mars, of Venus, of the Jovian Moons -- Judd Whitney had seen enough of extraterrestrial life to know that virtually anything was possible, and Black Eyes would be no exception to that rule. \"What do you propose to do?\" Judd demanded. \"Do? Why, we'll have to kill your creature, naturallv. You can set a   value on it and we will meet it, but Black Eyes must die.\" \"No!\" Lindy cried. \"You can't be sure, you're only guessing, and it isn't fair!\" \"My dear woman, don't you realize this is a serious situation? The city's people will starve in time, No one can even bring food in because the trucks make too much noise! As an alternative, we could evacuate, but is your pet more valuable than the life of a great city?\" itJsJ #  In no... \"Then, please! Listen to reason!\" \"Kill it,\" Judd said. \"Go ahead.\" Dr. Jamison withdrew from his pocket a small blasting pistol used by the Department of Domestic Animals for elimination of injured creatures. He advanced on Black Eyes, who sat on its haunches in the center of the room, surveying the scientist. ' :  : Dr. Jamison put his blaster away. \"I can't' he said. \"I don't want to.\" Judd smiled. \"I know it. No one -- no thing -- can kill Black Eyes. You said so yourself. It was a waste of time to try it. In that case -- --\" \"In that case' Dr. Jamison finished for him, \"we're helpless. There isn't a man -- or an animalon Earth that will destroy this I thing. Wait a minute -- does it sleep, Mr. Whitney?\" \"I don't think so. At least, I never saw it sleep. And your team of scientists, did they report anything?\" \"No. As far as they could see, the creature never slept. We can't catch it unawares.\" \"Could you anesthetize it?\" \"How? It can sense danger, and long before you could do that, it would stop you. It's only made one mistake, Mr. Whitney: it believes the noises of the city represent a danger. And that's only a negative mistake. Noise won't hurt Black Eyes, of course. It simply makes the animal unnecessarily cautious. But we cannot anesthetize it any more than we can kill it;\" \"I could take it back to Venus.\" \"Could you? Could you? I hadnH thought of that.\" Judd shook his head. \"I can't.\" \"What do you mean you can't?\" \"It won't let me. Somehow it can sense our thoughts when we think something it doesn't want. I can't take it to Venus! No man could, because it doesn't want to go.\" \"My dear Mr. Whitney -- do you mean to say you believe it can think r \"Uh-uh. Didn't say that. It can sense our thoughts, and that's something else again.\" Dr. Jamison threw his hands up over his head in a dramatic gesture. \"It's hopeless.\" he said. York crawled along to a standstill People began to move from the city. In trickles, at first, but the trickles became torrents, as New depart for saner places. It might take months -- it\" might even take years, but the exodus had begun. Nothing could stop it. Because of a harmless little beast with the eyes of a tarsier. the life of a great city was coming to an end. Word spread. Scientists all over the world studied reports on Black Eyes. No one had any ideas. Everyone was stumped. Black Eyes had no particular desire to go outside. Black Eyes merely remained in the Whitney house, contemplating nothing in particular, and stopping everything. Dr. Jamison, however, was a persistent man. Judd got a letter from him one day, and the following afternoon he kept his appointment with the scientist \"It's good to get out,\" Judd said, after a three hour walk to the Department of Science Building. \"I can go crazy just staring at that thing.\" i \"I have it, Whitney.\" \"You have what? Not the way to destroy Black Eyes? I don't believe it!\" \"It's true. Consider. Everyone in the world does not yet know' of your pet, correct?\"  . \"I suppose there are a few people who don't -- \"  \"There are many. Among them, are the crew of a jet-bomber which has been on maneuvers in Egypt. We have arranged everything.\" \"Yes? How?\" ' \"At noon tomorrow, the bomber will appear over your home with  fa explosive will nity, and, preee in the afterdestroyed with it. e. \"I too easy.\" asy? I doubt if the animal will ever sense what is going oncrew of the bomber nowj either. They'll coner it a mighty peculiar order, to estroy one harmless, rather large and rather elaborate suburban home. But they'll do it. See you tomorrow, Whitney, after this mess is behind us.\" \"Yeah\" Judd said. \"Yeah.\" But somehow, the scientist had failed to instill any of his confidence in Judd. If eleven the following morning, after making a thorough list of all their properties which the City had promised to duplicate. Judd did look at Black Eyes as he left, the animal remained where it on its haunches under room table, nibbling almost feel the a pair of twin he dared not face them... away at their way \"I know.\" \"Do you \"I -- IJudd knew to be done with didn't like the little way, that had nothin Black Eyes was a ered in Don't let them , don't It wasn't Judd and it wasn subconscious.

And you're wonderful -- \" No one volunteered to spend his life in exile with Black Eyes, but then Dr. Jamison pointed out that while no one knew the creature's life-span, it certainly couldn't be expected to match man's. Just a few years and the beast would die, and... Dr. Jamison's arguments were so logical that he convinced himself. He took Black Eyes with him into the Canadian North woods, and there they live.

I liked the Prof. Such a fine old gentleman, to go whacky from so much success Jake took a few shots of the Profs rabbits and guinea pigs, of the Prof himself, and of the apparatus he had constructed which he claimed drove out the causative poison of age; a poison he called a radioactive isotope of Potassium The other reporters, not bavin soft hearts Jake and I toted aroun wrote him up as a joke; sal out they thought the blowing his top. Immortality They presented the a farce. No reporters were wrong than those s Profs little over and y started. What kind of things? Well, up to that line, things were normal ; but beyond it, grass got enormous, the ground was higher and softer. Trees forgot to shed their leaves. Animals flocked there to eat the lush grass, so the Prof erected a ten-foot electrified fence around his land to keep out the hordes of rabbits, deer, mice and what have you that came to feast off the new supply of better forage. That was only the beginning. Some months later there came items about houseflies the size of walnuts hatching out around the Profs retreat. Now a swarm of houseflies the size of walnuts is news, and Jake and I got up there on the jump. It was terrific! The flies were there all right, but so were a good many other oversized creatures. Roosting in the trees were robins, bluebirds, and doves as large as turkeys. King-sized ducks waddled about importantly, displaying pouter-pigeon crops from overeating. It was as if some god had drawn a line and said : \"This is the new Eden, where all living tilings will prosper terrifically.\" You never saw a sight like it! Or did you? Were you one of the horde who started camping around the Profs magic circle trying to get permission to enter? It was then we got proof that it pays to be kind. Of all the newsgrabbers who surrounded the Profs big wire gate, Jake and I were the only ones who got in. The old man had not forgotten who had taken him seriously and who had made fun of him. Jake snapped a series of startling pics of the oversized animals and birds. I interviewed the Prof again, even got his maid, Tilda's opinions, and wrote it up as unsensationally as possible, playing down the tremendous potential for trouble, placing up the really effective method the old scientist had discovered for \"eliminating the deterioration factor\" in life. I could see where the world was in for some changes, and the going was going to be rough enough for the old man without making it worse. But my efforts came to naught when the pics Jake had taken reached the editor's desk. He hit the ceiling, called me on the carpet, wanted to know where my news sense had gotten lost. Then he sent out three other smart boys to do a good job on it. The paper got out a special edition -- and the troubles I had foreseen began. First, the government stepped in, trying to hush-hush the whole thing; but too late. The rush had started. For miles around the poor Prof's fenced-in hideaway, cars and trailers parked in a mad sensejess jumble. People crowded against the fences and the electricity had to be shut off. Some smart aleck produced wire cutters and made an opening. The invasion of the new Eden had begun. Stegner took flight, taking his secret apparatus and files with him. He declined police escort, and vanished from his mad Eden. Where he went was impossible to learn, but I supposed the government knew. The area he had revitalized with nine davs tile birds. Ap the end of the had triumphed with its usual stupid us remembered, could out. of our minds the significance of what the old man had had pointed the way to a lush immortality, and he had been shoved aside and pawed over and written about like some fredc. If .he had been a notorious criminal, he would have gotten far better journalistic treatment. But the years went by -- four, five of them. And nothing more was heard of Stegner and his work. Until, one day coming home from a night shifttbn the paper, I found a letter in my box. It was a rather plain looking envelope, but much sr than the ordinary. The handwritten address was quite Icgl!e, but very big, as if a giant hand itself to produce ordinary script :  far gotten tne, you. If you would r a time , insert a F in the ect .

But the land of brobdignags I found staggered me. Grasses, trying to be trees, and trees . There were no words for the bigness, the health and vitality of Steg ner and the government who hd welcomed him here in South America. But Stegner hustled me aside before I had time to  do more than goggle at the mainmoth layout of this new Eden under government  supervision.

They can do it, too. Their minds have increased in power. Growth is that way. But moral values are something different -- they are acquired by experience. Find some moral men who might use this information to circumvent what is about to happen.\" I took the papers and shook his gigantic hand. I left via the back door, and sneaked through a clump of giant ferns to the edge of the airfield. A little prowling revealed a parked plane, long unused because those who had flown it here had grown too big to use it. I waited, hidden in the lush greenery until the setting sun would hide my movements. It would only be a few minutes now... The hangar in which the plane was parked contained several gasoline drums, the kind with pumps on them that worked with a crank. I got into the hangar, finally, and before it got too dark to see, checked the plane's gas gauge. It was about a quarter full. I connected the gas hose and started pumping. In twenty minutes I had her full, then I climbed into the plane... When the motor caught, after I was sure it never would, the thunder of the prop brought giants running toward me from the far end of the field, their twenty-foot strides eating up the distance. But I taxied straight toward them, giving the plane's motors all they would take. The plane roared down the field, and they fell flat as the prop came at them. The plane lifted, spun over them, was off. Now slugs from oversize rifles came buzzing about me, crashing through the fuselage. But it was dark and I was away. No serious damage had been done. In Texas it took me four hours to get the brass to listen to me. Finally they did. They didn't ask me to keep my mouth shut. They just turned me loose. I went to my editor and told him the truth. He didn't believe me. When he checked with the army, they said I was obviously trying to perpetrate a hoax. I nearly got fired. waited. I knew I'd have to wait until my chance came. There' d have to be hellfire before anybody'd believe my story. Then the storm broke, in sensational headlines. \"Gigantic beasts wipe out town in South America.\" My editor sent for me. He showed me the headline. \"Maybe I made a mistake not believing your story about Stegner,\" he said. \"I make a lot of mistakes.\" \"You want me to cover this?\" I said. v \"That's it. And if you can come up with proof of what you toldme when you got back from that crazy trip, I'll print every damned word.\" I knew they were at last taking it seriously. The locals had called out the army to fight the strange monsters that were coming out of the jungle. They were such things as army ants six feet long; anteaters looking like ambling locomotives with hairy hides and noses; lumbering sloths vast as a houses on legs, sleepy and comic as ever, but terrifyingly destructive; jaguars like trucks and trailers; centipedes with stingers over their backs that would reach a man in a third-story' window; wasps and bees like buzzards. The army was lashing at. these things with machine guns, flame throwers, tanks and rockets. Jeeps careened across the landscape with loads of ammo. It was a madhouse on a vast scale, and being fought to the death. They waited for the beasts to come out of the jungle, then they jumped them -- or were jumped. Nobody was allowed to fly into the hinterland to see where they were coming from. And when I tried to get officials to consider it, they absolutely refused. Up there, it was hinted, were secret government projects -- besides they were too far away -- and radio said there was no sign of anything unusual there. It was worth even a general's job to poke his nose in near those projects. And how could I tell these people traitorous men of their own government were the culprits? It just wasn't possible -- and because I had to stay on the scene, I never even hinted it. I merely waited my chance to produce proof. I knew I'd get it, sooner or later. Something would come out of that jungle I'd be able to use to convey the real menace to the knowledge of a puzzled world. I wrote carefully, reporting the weird war with the animal world -- and I kept inserting paragraphs hinting about Stcgner and his growth field, adding \"rumors\" that maybe his work had been taken over by a power-mad clique and it was they who were loosing this horror. My  boss liked the stuff I was putting in, because it sold papers, and I was careful to keep my facts separate, and label my theories. Nobody -- at least so it seemed -- believed the theories, but they made good reading. I got a raise in salary. Other reporters were knocking out stories as good as mine, but without the insight into the facts that I had. So their stories went too far afield. Mine became popular, and were in demand as reprints all over the world. But officially, nobody paid any attention to me, so the important papers nestled the bottom of my trunk. I didn't want them confiscated until the time came when I could publish them with proof. My boss would back me up when that proof came. I was sure of that. I got my chance the day the giantess came crashing out of the smoke and dust of the circle of horror across which the beasts were constantly lunging. She was near naked, and half mad with pain from the giant insects plaquing her. No one fired on her as she stood with uplifted arms, waiting for the soldiers to kill her as she expected. Beautiful as a goddess out of an ancient myth she came forward toward the soldiers, her face lighting with hope, her hair streaming golden in the sun. She spoke to us then, and the silence that came over the field of carnage was com\"Look at me! Look at me and believe! There are others like me, back in the jungle; mad giants who plan to conquer your world. They are ready to do it. I have escaped to warn you. They are mad, these giants my master has created. They are monsters...\" I recognized her now. My senses leaped and my blood pounded in my veins. Here was my opportunity to convince the world. This was Tilda, Stegner s maid! I snapped several pictures of her as she went on talking. \"These men, who were once your own leaders are plotting to destroy you and take the world for themselves. You do not know what they are preparing for you, but I come to tell you. Make ready, for they arc on their way to destroy you. They bring huge guns, monster tanks that they have built, machines never before seen on earth.\" What more she might have told we were never to know, for she fell then, at the end of her strength. Whatever she had dared, whatever she had gone through to break out of that monstrous circle and come to us, had been too much even for her giant's strength. She fell, like a tower crashing down, and lay there, a great lax pile of pink and red flesh, torn by thorns, the claws of animals, the stingers of terrible giant insects. Then the monsters came again, and we could not go to her. She lay there as darkness came, and in the morning only her skeleton remained. stripped of flesh in the night by the myriad devouring giant ants and beetles. V photos of Tilda. My editor printed the whole story, printed my formulae, printed every word of the history of Stegner and his creations, and the secret menace he had unwittingly loosed on the world from his second hidden Eden in the jungle. I was called home. They came to me then, those moral ones Stegner had said existed. Men high in government and army circles who had the peace and welfare of the world at heart. Selfless ones whose records were above reproach. And they proved to be high in the powers of the world, able to command. to my reporting. I wanted to be on hand when the attack of which Tilda had warned became reality... I was some twelve miles from the deadly circle when the giant tanks appeared. They were larger than any moving thing ever seen on Earth before. Tracklayers, caterpillars -- and swinging above them slender towers which bore ominous gleaming nozzles. On they came. Then they struck at us. From the unnameable, that swept forward like a slow lightning, a kind of crackling sheet of cold fire that spread from tower to tower, in an arc that began to bend toward our lines. The fire came in mile-wide swaths. There was no outcry, no terror -- just the sweating lines of men in foxholes, the crews about the guns, heaving ammo into their maws; the rumbling trucks and the careening jeeps. The fire swept over all like liquid radiance, like a pouring out of moonlight, soft but was gone. And when it had gone, nothing but silence remained. Dead men stretched out where they  had lain waiting, fallen where they labored ; jeeps careened on to crash into, stumps or bigger trucks -- and stop forever, Only silence and death and nothingness was left. When the silence swept across the whole front I dropped my glasses and lit out for my own car, and headed for the coast. I wanted to file this story in person, and I knew, too, that army would not be there in the morning. I meant to stay alive. I knew that the hope for mankind lay in what honest men were doing with Stegner's formulae. I had to know. So I fled. Next day they were dropping atom bombs on every moving thing in Stegncr's ghastly Eden. High flying bombers flew in swarms -- and many of them were being shot down by the weird fire. I saw those atom bombs falling, on television, and the white radiance reaching up toward them. I saw' it catch them in its embrace, saw them explode harmlessly in the air, midway in in their plunge. Whatever the fire was, it was a defense against the atom bomb, for it exploded them before they could reach their targets.  It didn't catch them all, and it didn't intercept all the high-flying bombers loosing their guided rocket missiles. It got enough though, to show us we were on the losing end. What we needed was a miracle. And the miracle did occur... At first, even with my fingers on every tag end of information that came out of the terrible area, it was an unnoticeable change. Then I got it. The men doing our fighting changed in caliber and ability. I never learned, due to the official habit of hushing everything up, just whose technology accomplished the miracle, but it must have been started from the first, with those army officers who had listened to me with such lack of interest when I spoke before their inquisition at the Texas army air field. All I learned was that there was a new kind of man busy at the front, a man of keener intellect, swifter of action, infinitely more able than the former ordinary soldier. It was Jake who first confirmed my suspicions. He brought in photographs of men lifting trucks out of mudholes, men tearing steel cables apart with their bare hands, men jumping over twenty-foot barriers with full pack. \"Whatta I do with that kind of pic? The people are so fed up with the impossible news they are getting that they don't believe anything any more! But you and I know a news camera doesn't lie... it doesn't have' time!\" They had put the Profs formulae to work against the giants. This time it was the right formulae. They had growth without increase in size, a growth of ability, of strength, of mentality, without any increase in ponderous structure. These new soldiers were the policemen of the United Nations made into supermen! I began to believe in the human race again. \"Great!\" I said. \"This iswhat I've been waiting for!\" Jake tossed me his pictures and went away. I turned to the typewriter and began batting out my story: \"Mankind solves the problem of giantism! The new weapon against the giants is -- the new man!\" Those little giants waded into that circle through all the deadly fire and the giant scorpions and vast beasts like Jack-the-GiantKiller's multitudinous sons -- and it wasn't a month later that I typed the last story of my life and gave up reporting for good. It was the tale of the death of the last giant -- and Jake's picture of him, armed in the end with only his fists, huge as a tree, mad with hunger and thirst and terrible fear of the little men who were just as mighty, a lot quicker, and every bit as smart as any giant. They routed him out with tear gas and shot him down with plain old GI rifle fire. Yes, I gave up newspaper work. Why? They offered me a job making a movie out of the \"War of the Giants\". The job gave me quick money, which is what I needed.  The wife and I are starting a new colony on Malino Island. It's in the Carelinas. We're going to try this growth-without-size business out properly. Yes, that' s my son. Eight months. He doesn't ordinarily go around dragging a piano -- it just got in his way.  underestimate... Lefferts  madness could drive all women back into slavery -- it could even cost Lucinda a mink coat! course  # said Lucinda, passing the marmalade, \"but the brass was beautifully polished. The whole thing made me quite angry, though at the same time I was delighted.\" Meticulously Dr. Lefferts closed the newly-arrived Journal of the Micro-biological Institute y placed it cm the copy of Strength of Materials in Various Radioisotopic Alloys which lay beside his plate, and carefully removed his pincenez. \"You begin in mid-sequence,\" he said, picking up a butter-knife. \"Your thought is  predicate without a stated subject. Finally, your description of your reactions contains parts which appear mutually exclusive.\" He attacked the marmalade. \"Will you elucidate?\" Lucinda laughed good-humoredly. \"Of course, darling. Where would you like me to begin?\" \"Oh... Dr. Lefferts made a vague gesture. \"Practically anywhere. Anywhere at all. Simply supply more relative data in order that I may extrapolate the entire episode and thereby dispose of it. Otherwise I shall certainly keep returning to it all day long.

And yet that situation is one that has obtained through the ages. Women have always been able to get what they wanted from men by pretending to promise a thing which they know r men want but will not or cannot take. Mind you. I'm not talking about situations where this yielding is the main issue. I'm talking about the infinitely greater number of occasions where yielding has nothing to do with it. Like w'easeling out of traffic tickets.\" \"Or skillfully gaining your husband's reluctant attention over the breakfast table.\" Her sudden laughter was like a shower of sparks. \"You'd better get down to the Institute,\" she said. \"You'll be late.\" He arose, picked up his book and pamphlet, and walked slowly to the door. Lucinda came with him, hooking her arm through his. Suddenly he stopped, and without looking at her, asked quietly, \"That policeman was a manipulated, undignified fool, wasn't he?\" \"Of course he was, darling, and it made a man of him.\" He nodded as if accepting a statistic, and, kissing her, walked out I of the house. Darling , she thought, dear sweet chrome-plated , fine-drawn , highpolished blue-print...

There he paused and looked back. \"This has been going an too long he called. \"I shall alter it.\" Lucinda stopped smiling. AY I come in?\" \"Jenny, of course.\" Lucinda went to the kitchen door and unhooked it. \"Come in, come in. My, you're prettier than ever this morning.\" \"I brought you violets,\" said Jenny breathlessly. \"Just scads of 'em in the woods behind my place. You took your red curtains down. Is that a new apron? My! you had Canadian bacon for breakfast.\" She darted in past Lucinda, a small, wiry, vibrant girl with sunlit hair and moonlit eyes. \"Can I help with the dishes?\" \"Thank you, you doll.\" Lucinda took down a shallow glass bowl for the violets. Jenny busily ran hot water into the sink. \"I couldn't help seeing,\" she said. \"Your big picture window... Lucinda, you never leave the breakfast dishes. I keep telling Bob, some day I'll have the routines you have, everything always so neat, never running out of anything, never in a hurry, never surprised... anyway, all the way over I could see you just sitting by the table there, and the dishes not done and all... is everything all right? I mean, don't tell me if I shouldn't ask, but I couldn't help... Her voice trailed off into an ardent and respectful mumble. \"You're such a sweetheart,\" Lucinda said mistily. She came over to the sink carrying clean dishtowels and stood holding them, staring out past Jenny's head to the level lawns of the village. \"Actually, I did have something on my mind... something . , She related the whole conversation over breakfast that morning, from her abrupt and partial mentioning of the anecdote about the blonde and the policeman, to her husband's extraordinary andunequivocal statement about women's power over men: This has bee?i go ing on too long. I shall alter it. \"Is that all?\" Jenny asked when she had finished. \"Mm. It's all that was said.\" \"Oh, I don't think you should worry about that.\" She crinkled up her eyes, and Lucinda understood that she was putting herself and her young husband in the place of Lucinda and Dr. Lefferts, and trying to empathize a solution. \"I think you might have hurt his feelings a little, maybe,\" Jenny said at length. \"I mean, you admitted that you handled him in much the same way as that blonde handled the policeman, and then you said the policeman was a fool\" Lucinda smiled. \"Very shrewd. And what's your guess about that parting shot?\" Jenny turned to face her. \"You're not teasing me, asking my opinion, Lucinda? I never thought I'd see the day l Not you -- you're so wise!\" Lucinda patted her shoulder. \"The older I get, the more I feel that among women there is a lowest common denominator of wisdom, and that the chief difference between them is a random scattering of blind spots. No, honey, I'm not teasing you. You may be able to see just where I can't. Now tell me: what do you think he meant by that?' # \" e I shall alter it', Jenny quoted thoughtfully. \"Oh, I don't think he meant anything much. You showed him how you could make him do things, and he didn't like it. He's decided not to let you do it any more, but -- but... \"But what?\" \"Well, it's tike with Bob. When he gets masterful and lays down the law I just agree with him. He forgets about it soon enough. If you agree with men all the time they cant get stubborn about anything.\"Lucinda laughed aloud. \"There's the wisdom!\" she cried. Sobering, site shook her head. \"You don't know the doctor the way I do. He's a great man -- a truly great one, with a great mind. It' great in a way no other mind has ever been. H#V- different. Jenny, I know how people talk, and what a lot of them say. People wonder why I married him, why I've stayed with him all these years. They say he's stuffy and didactic and that he has no sense of humor, Weil, to them he may be ; but to me hfc is a continual challenge. The rules-ofthumb that keep most men in line don't apply to him. \"And if he says he can do something, he can. If he says he will do something, he will.\" Jenny dried her hands and sat down slowly. \"He meant,\" she said positively, \"that he would alter your ability to make him do things. Because die only other thing he could have meant was that he was going to alter the thing that makes it possible for any woman to handle any man. And that just couldn't be. How could he change human nature?\" \"How? How? He's the scientist. I'm not. I simply eliminate that 'how' from my thinking. The worrisome thing about it is that he doesn't think in small ways about small issues. I'm afraid that's just what he meant -- that he was going to change some factor in humanity that is responsible for this power we have over men.\" \"Oh... really.\" said Jenny. She looked up at Lucinda, moved her hands uneasily. \"Lucinda, I know how great the doctor is, and how much you think of him, but -- but no one man could do such a thing! Not ouside of his own home.\" She grinned fleetingiy. \"Probably not inside of it, for very long... I never understood just what sort of a scientist he is. Can you tell me, I mean, aside from any secret projects he might be on? Like Bob, now; Bob's a hightemperature metallurgist. What is the doctor, exactly?\" \"That's the right question to ask,\" Lucinda said, and her voice was shadowed. \"Dr. Lefferts is a -- well, the closest you could get to it would be to call him a specializing non-specialist. You see, science has reached the point where each branch of it continually branches into specialties, and each specialty has its own crop of experts. Most experts live in the confines of their own work. The doctor was saving just the other day that he'd discovered a fluorine-boron step-reaction in mineralogy that had been known for so long that the mineralogists had forgotten about it -- yet it was unknown to metallurgy. Just as I said a moment ago, his mind is great, and -- different. His job is to draw together the chemists and the biologists, the pure mathematicians and the practical physicists, the clinical psychologists and the engineers and all the otherists andologies. His specialty is scientific thought as applied to all the sciences. He has no assignments except to survey all the fields and transfer needed information from one to the other. There has never been such a position in the Institute before, nor a man to fill it.

What is the power he's talking about, and where does it come from, and what wou will... happen if it's changed?\" \"I don't know,\" Lucinda said thought! ully, # # I -- do- -- not -- know. f # fof nrir!p in tbs rrtnwrf i'KIa that sort of thing is just one of the things a woman naturally does, because she Is a woman, without thinking of it.\" Unexpectedly, Jenny giggled. \"You don't plan those things. You just do them. It's nice when it works. A better roast from the butcher. A reminder from one of the men at the bank that a check's overdrawn, in time to cover it.\" \"I know, # ' smiled Lucinda, \"I know'. It's easy and inaccurate to say that all those men are on the prowl -- or all those women either. A few are, but most are not. The women has survived even equal opportunity and equal pay for women. The ability of women to get what they want from men lies completely in their knowledge of that band wants to alter -- will alter -- lies in that department. \"Lucinda, why don't you just ask him?\" \"I shall. But I don't know if I'll get an answer. If he regards it as a security matter, nothing will get it out of him.\" # # You I #I tell me, won't you?\" \"Jenny, my sweet, if he tells me nothing, I can't tell you. If he tells me and asks me to keep his confidence, I won't tell you. If he tells me and puts no restrictions on it. I'll tell you everything.\" \"But -- \"  \"I know, dear. You're thinking that it's a bigger thing than just what it might mean to the two of us. Well, you're right. But deep I'm confidents I'd pit women again?    pect them to win out. But anytime all womankind is against all mankind, the men don't stand a chance. Think hard about it, anyway. At least we should be able to figure out where the attack is coming from.\" \"At least you admit it's an attack\" #  \"You bet your sweet life it's an attack. There's been a woman behind most thrones all through history. The few times that hasn't been true, it's taken a woman to clean up the mess afterward. We won't give up easily, darling!\" blow', and we shall have snow', and so on \" said Lucinda as she lit the fire. \"I'm going to need a new coat.\" \"Very well,\" said Dr. LefTerts. \"A fur coat this time.\" \"Fur coats,\" pronounced the doctor, \"are impractical. Get one with the fur inside. You'll keep warmer with less to carry'.\" \"I want a fur coat with the fur outside, where it shows.\" \"I understand and at times admire the decorative compulsions,\" said the doctor, rising from the adjusted cube he used for an easy chair, \"but not when they are unhealthy, uneconomical, and inefficient. My dear, vanity does not become you.\" \"A thing that has always fascinated me \" said Lucinda in a dangerously quiet voice, \"in rabbits, weasels, skunks, pumas, pandas, and mink, and all other known mammals and marsupials, is their huge vanity. They all wear their fur outside.\" He put on his pince-nez to stare at her. \"Your logic limits its factors. I find such sequences remarkable because of the end results one may obtain. However, I shall not follow this one.\" \"If you're so preoccupied with efficiency and function,\" she snapped, \"why do you insist on wearing those pince-nez instead of getting corneal lenses?\" \"Functional living is a pattern which includes all predictable phenomena,\" he said reasonably. \"One of these is habit. I recognize that I shall continue to like pincenez as much as I shall continue to dislike rice pudding. My functionalism therefore includes these glasses and excludes that particular comestible. If you had the fur-coat habit, the possibility of a fur coat would be calculable. Since you have never had such a coat, we' can consider the matter disposed of.\" \"I think some factors were selected for that sequence,\" said Lucinda between her teeth, \"but I can't seem to put my finger on the missing ones.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I said,\" appended Lucinda distinctly, \"that speaking of factors, I wonder how you're coming with your adjustment of human nature to eliminate the deadliness of the female.\" \"Oh, that. I expect results momentarily.\" \"Why bother?\" she said bitterly. \"My powers don't seem to be good enough for a fur coat as it is.\" \"Oh,\" he said mildly, \"wereyou using them? # ' Because she was Lucinda, she laughed. \"No, darling, I wasn't;' She went to him and pressed him hack into the big cubical chair and sat on the arm. \"I was demanding, cynical, and unpleasant. These things in a woman represent the scorched earth retreat, rather than the looting advance.\" \"An excellent analogy' he said. \"Excellent. It has been a long and bitter war, hasn't it? And now it's coming to an end. It is an extraordinary thing that in our difficult progress toward the elimination of wars, we have until now ignored the greatest and most pernicious conflict of all -- the one between the sexes.\" \"Why so pernicious?\" she chuckled. \"There are times when it's rather fun.\" He said solemnly, \"There are moments of exhilaration, even of glory, in every great conflict. Rut such conflicts tear down so much more than they build.\" \"What's been so damaging about the war between the spxes?\" \"Though it has been the women who made men, it has been largely men who have made the world as we know it. However, they have had to do so against a truly terrible obstacle: . the emotional climate created by women. Only by becoming an ascetic can a man avoid the oscillations between intoxication and distrust instilled into him by women. And ascetics usually are already insane or rapidly become so.\" \"I think you're overstating a natural state of affairs.\" # T am overstating # he admitted, \"for clarity's sake, and off the record. However, this great war is by no means natural On the contrary, it is a most unnatural state of affairs. You see, homo sapieris is, in one small but important respect, an atypical mammal\" \"Do tell.\" He raised his eyebrows, but continued. \"In virtually all species hut ours, the female has a rigidly fixed cycle of conjugal acceptability.\" \"But the human female has a -- \" \"I am not referring to that lunar cycle, unmentionable everywhere except in blatant magazine advertisements # he said shortly, \"but to a cycle of desire. Of rut.\" \"A pretty word.\" Her eyes began to glitter. \"Mahomet taught that it occurred every eight days, Zoroaster nine days, Socrates and Solon agreed on ten. Everyone e#e, as far as I can discover, seems to disagree with these pundits, or to ignore the matter. Actually there are such cycles, but they are subtle at best, and differ in the individual from time to time, with age, physical experience, geography, and even emotional state. These cycles are vestigial; the original, natural cycle disappeared early in the history of the species, and has been trembling on the verge ever since. It will be a simple matter to bring it back.\" \"May I ask how?\" \"You may not. It is a security matter.\" \"May I then ask what effect you expect this development to have?\" \"Obvious, isn't it? The source of woman's persistent and effective control over man, the thing that makes him subject to all her intolerances, whims, and bewildering coyness, is the simple fact of her perennial availability. She has no regular and predictable cycle of desire. The lower animals have. During the brief time that a female mouse, a marten, or a mare is approachable, every male of her species in the vicinity will know of it and seek her out; will, in effect, drop everything to answer a basic call. But unless and until that call occurs, the male is free to think of other things. With the human female, on the other hand, the call is mildly present at all times, and the male is never completely free to think of other things. It is natural for this drive to be strong. It is unnatural indeed for it to be constant. In this respect Freud was quite correct; nearly every neurosis has a sexual Ijasis. We are a race of neurotics, and the great wonder is that we have retained any of the elements of sanity at all. I shall liberate humanity from this curse. I shall restore the natural alternations of drive and rest. I shall free men to think and women to take their rightful places as thinking individuals beside them, rather than be the forced-draft furnaces of sexual heat they have become.\" \"Are you telling me,\" sajd Lucinda in a small, shocked voice, \"that you have found a way to -- to neuterize women except for a few hours a month?\" \"I am and I have,\" said Dr. Lefferts. \"And incidentally, I must say I am grateful to you for having turned me to this problem.\" He looked up sharply. \"Where are you going, my dear?\" 'Tve got to ththink,\" said Lucinda, and ran from the room. If she had stayed there for another fifteen seconds, she knew she would have crushed his skull in with the poker. W HO -- Oh, Lucinda! How nice. Come in... why, what's the matter?\" \"Jenny, Tve got to talk to you. Is Bob home?\" \"No. He's got night duty at the high temperature lab this week. Whatever is wrong?\" \"It's the end of the world,\" said Lucinda in real anguish. She sank down on the sofa and looked up at the younger woman. \"My husband is putting a -- a chastity belt on every woman on earth.\" \"A what?\" \"A chastity belt.\" She began to laugh hysterically. \"With a timelock on it.\" c Jenny sat beside her. \"Don't,\" she said. \"Don't laugh like that. You're frightening me.\" Lucinda lay back, gasping. \"You should be frightened... Listen to me, Jenny. Listen carefully, because this is the biggest thing that has happened since the deluge.\" She began to talk. Five minutes later Jenny asked dazedly, \"You mean-if this crazy thing happens Bob won't... won't want me most of the time?\" \"It's you who won't do .any wanting. And when you don't, he won't want either... It isn't that that bothers me so much, Jenny, now that I've had a chance to think about it. Fm worried about the revolution.\" # 'What revolution?\" \"Why, this is going to cause the greatest social upheaval of all time! Once these cycles become recognized for what they are, there will be fireworks. Look at the way we dress, the 'way we use cosmetics. Why do we do it? Basically, to appear to be available to men. Practically all perfumes have a musk or musk-like base for that very reason. But how long do you think women will keep up the hypocrisy of lipstick and plunging necklines when men know better -- know that they couldn't possibly be approachable all the time? How many men will let their women appear in pub lie looking as if they were?\" \"They'll tie us up in the house the way I do Mitzi-poodle,\" said Jenny in an awed tone. \"They'll leave us smugly alone with easy minds for three weeks out of four,\" said Lucinda, \"and stand guard over us like bull elks the rest of the time, to keep other men away.\" \"Lucinda!\" Jenny squeaked and covered her face in horror. \"What about other women? How can we compete with another woman when she's -- she's -- and we're not?\" \"Especially when men are conditioned the way they are. Women will want to stick to one man, more likely than not. But men -- men, building up pressures for weeks on end... \" \"There'll be harems again,\" said Jenny. \"This is the absolute, final, bitter end of any power we ever had over the beasts, Jenny -- do you see that? All the old tricks -- the arch halfpromise, the come-on, the manipulations of jealousy -- they!! be utterly meaningless! The whole arsenal of womankind is based on her ability to yield or not to yield. And my husband is going to take the choice away from us. He's going to make it absolutely certain that at  one time we can't yield, and at another we must!\" \"And they'll never have to be nice to us at either time,\" added Jenny miserably. \"Women,\" said Lucinda bitterly, \"are going to have to work for a living.\" \"But we do!\" \"Oh, you know what I mean, J enny! The iit-tul wife in the lit-fcul ome... that whole concept is based on women's perpetual availability. We're not going to be able to be home-makers, in that sense, at monthly intervals.\" Jenny jumped up. Her face was chalky. \"He hasn't stopped any war,\" she ground out. Lucinda had never seen her like this. \"He's started one, and it's a beaut. Lucinda, he's got to be stopped, even if you -- we have to... \"Gome on.\" They started for Dr. Lefferts' house, striding along dike a couple of avenging angels. A h ; # said dr. lefferts, rising politely. \"You brought Jenny. Good evening. Jenny.\" Lucinda planted herself in front of him and put her hands on her hips. \"'You listen to me,\" she no growled. \"You've got to stop that nonsense about changing women.\" \"It is not nonsense and I shall do nothing of the kind \" \"Dr Lefferts,\" said Jenny in a quaking voice, \"can you really do this -- tins awful thing?\" \"Of course,\" said the doctor. \"It was quite simple, once the principles were worked out. # \" \"It was quite simple? You mean you've already -- \" Dr. Lefferts looked at his watch. \"At two o'clock this afternoon. Seven hours ago.\" \"I think,\" said Lucinda quietly, \"that you had better tell us just exactly what you did, and what we can expect.\" \"I told you it is a security matter\" \"What has my libido to do with national defense?\" \"That,\" said the doctor, in a tone which referred to that as the merest trifle, \"is a side issue. I coincided it with a much more serious project.\" \"What could be more serious than... \"There's only one thing that serious, from a security standpoint,\" said Lucinda. She turned to the doctor. \"I know better than to ask you any direct questions. But if I assume that this horrible thing was done in conjunction with a super-bomb test -- just a guess, you understand -- is there any way for an H-blast to bring about a change in women such as you describe?\" He clasped both hands around one knee and looked up at her in said... \"And most skilfully phrased. Speaking hypothetically -- hypothetically, you understand,\" he interjected, waving a warning finger, \"a hydrogen bomb has an immense power of diffusion. A jet of energy of that size, at that temperature, for even three or four microseconds, is capable of penetrating the upper reaches of the stratosphere. But the effect does not end there. The upward displacement causes great volumes of air to rush in toward the rising column from all sides. This in turn is carried upward and replaced, a process which continues for a considerable time. One of the results must be the imbalance of any distinct high or low pressure areas within several thousand miles, and for a day or two freak weather developments can be observed. In other words, these primary and secondary effects are capable of diffusing a -- ah -- substance placed in the bomb throughout the upper atmosphere, where, in a matter of days, it will be diffused throughout the entire envelope.\" Lucinda clasped her hands in a slow, controlled way, as if one of them planned to immobilize the other and thereby keep both occupied. \"And is there any substance... , I'm still asking hypothetical questions, you understand -- is there anything which could be added to the hydrogen fusion reaction which might bring about these -- these new cycles in women?\" \"'They are not new cycles,\" said the doctor flatly. \"They are as old as the development of warmblooded animals. The lack of them is, in biological terms, a very recent I ! development in an atypical mamma #; so recent and so small that it is subject to adjustment. As to your hypothetical question -- \" he smiled -- \"I should judge that such an effect is perfectly possible. Within the extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation which take place in a fusion reaction, many things are possible. A minute quantity of certain alloys, for example, introduced into the shell of the bomb itself, or perhaps in die structure of a supporting tower or even a nearby temporary shed, might kky a number of phenomenal reaction chains. Such a chain might go through several phases and result in certain subtle isotopic alterations in one of the atmosphere's otherwise inert gases, say xenon. And this isotope, acting upon the adrenal cortex and the parathyroid, which are instrumental in controlling certain cycles in the human body, might very readily brin about the effect we are discussing in an atypical species.\" Lucinda threw up her hands and turned to Jenny. \"Then that's it,\" she said wearily. \"What's 'it'? What? I don't understand,\" whimpered Jenny. \"What's he done, Lucinda?\" \"In his nasty, cold-blooded hypothetical way,\" said Lucinda, \"he has put something in or near an H-bomb. which was tested today, which is going to have some effect on the air we breathe, which is going to do what we were discussing at your house.\" \"Dr. Lefferts,\" said Jenny piteously. She went to him, stood looking down at him as he sat primly in his big easy chair. \"Why -- why? Ju gt to annoy us? Just to keep us from having a little, petty influence over you?\" \"By no means # said the doctor. \"I will admit that I might have turned my attention to the matter f for such reasons. But some concentrated thought brought up a number of extra-pol ations which are by no means petty.\" mantel, pince-nez in hand, the perfect picture of the Pedant At Home. \"Consider,\" he said. \"'Homo sapiens , in terms of comparative anatomy, should mature physically at # and emotionally between # and #. He should have a life expectancy of between # and # years. And he unquestionably should be able to live a life uncluttered by such insistent trifles as clothing conventions, unfunctional chivalries, psychic turmoils and dangerous mental and physical escapes into what the psychologists call romances. Women should phase their sexual cycles with those of the seasons, gestate their young longer, and eliminate the unpredictable nature of their psychosexual appetites -- the very basis of s all their insecurity and therefore that of most men. Women will not be chained to these cycles, Jenny, and become breeding machines, if that's what you fear. You will begin to live in and with these cycles as you live with a well-made and serviced automatic machine. You wall be liberated from the constant control and direction of your gomalic existence as you have been liberated from shifting gears in vour car.\"  \"But... we're not conditioned for such a change!\" blazed Lucinda. \"And what of the fashion industry... cosmetics... the entertainment world... what's going to become of these and the them, and the people dependent on all those people if you do a thing like this?\"  \"The tiling is done. As for these people... tie paused. \"Yes, there will be some disturbance. A considerable one. But in overall historical terms, it will be slight and it will be brief. I like to think that the television service man is one who was liberated by the cotton gin and the power loom.\" \"It's... hard to think in historical terms just now.\" said Lucinda. \"Jenny, come on.\" \"Where are you going?\" She faced him, her blued-steel eyes blazing. \"Away from you. And I -- I think I have a warning to give to the women.\" \"I wouldn't do that,\" he said dryly. \"They'll find out in time. All you'll succeed in doing is to alert many women to the fact that they will be unattractive to their husbands at times when other women may seem more desirable. Women will not unite with one another, my dear, even to unite against men\" There was a tense pause. Then jenny quavered, \"How long did you say this -- this thipg will take?\" \"I did not say. I would judge between thirty-six and forty-eight hours.\" \"I've got to get home.\" \"May I come with you?\" asked Lucinda. Jenny looked at her, her full face, her ample, controlled body, A surprising series of emotions chased themselves across her young face. She said, \"I don't think... I mean... no, not tonight; I have to -- to -- goodnight, Lucinda.\" When she had gone, the doctor uttered one of his rare chuckles. \"She has absorbed perhaps a tenth of this whole concept,\" he said, \"but until she's surer of herself she's not going to let you or any woman near her husband.\" \"You... you complacent pig ! # said Lucinda whitely. She stormed upstairs. \"Lucinda I I'm -- glad you called.\" Something cold and tense deep inside Lucinda relaxed. She sat down slowly on the couch, leaned back comfortably with the telephone cradled between her cheek and her wide soft shoulder. \"I'm glad you're glad, Jenny darling. It's been six weeks... how are you?\" \"I'm... all right now. It was pretty awful, for a while, not knowing how it would be, waiting for it to happen. And when it did happen, it was hard to get used to. But it hasn't changed things too much. How about you?\" \"Oh, I'm fine,\" said Lucinda. She smiled slowly, touched her tongue to her full lower lip. \"Jenny, have you told anyone?\" \"Not a soul. Not even Bob. I p think he's a little bewildered. He thinks I'm being very... understanding. Lucinda, is it wrong for me to let him think that?\" \"It's never wrong for a woman to keep her knowledge to herself if it makes her more attractive,\" said Lucinda, and smiled again. \"How's t)r. Lefferts?\" \"He's "
